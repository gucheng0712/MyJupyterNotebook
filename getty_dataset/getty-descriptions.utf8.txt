Anne Thistlewaite, the Countess of Chesterfield, appears lost in thought as she sits with her left arm resting on a plinth. Dense foliage furnishes a backdrop for her figure, while the right half of the painting provides a distant, unobstructed view of her lands. A pale beige shawl trimmed with gold fringe wraps loosely around her back and shoulders, and dainty white slippers emerge from underneath her elaborate blue satin gown. Her fashionable upswept hair and low-cut gown reveal the graceful curve of her neck and breast. Among Thomas Gainsborough's many portraits of English aristocrats, this large painting stands out as a remarkably loose and freely painted example. He conveyed a sense of immediacy in the large sweeping brushstrokes used to describe material, foliage, and background sky. Short, curved brushstrokes form the tree trunk, while longer strokes of blue and white paint create an illusion of shimmering, rustling fabric. Small dabs of white and gold paint applied to the shawl lend it a rich, glimmering effect.
These small enamel plaques present allegorical portraits of Charles IX and his mother, Queen Catherine de'Medici. On one plaque, Charles appears in the guise of Mars, wielding a shield and sword and drawn in a chariot by wolves, animals sacred to the god of war. Behind him, a war-ravaged land unfolds. In otherwordly pastel colors, tiny figures depict the effects of war on the bottom right. On the pendant plaque, Catherine appears as Juno, wife of Jupiter and mother of Mars. She wears a veil and carries a scepter, referring to Juno's roles as goddess of marriage and queen of the gods. Behind her chariot pulled by peacocks, a glorious rainbow arches above a peaceful pastoral landscape. The iconography, which may have been dictated by Catherine, probably celebrates her role in promoting the Peace of Saint Germain, which temporarily ended the Religious Wars in France. Her representation as Juno also refers to her success in arranging marriages between her children and foreign heads of states: she recently had negotiated Charles's marriage to Margaret of Austria, a political rival. Small-scale versions of oil paintings, these plaques were designed to be hung with other enamels in an intimate room.
On a small chalcedony cameo, Lucretia, the legendary heroine of ancient Rome, prepares to plunge a dagger into her side. The beautiful and virtuous wife of a nobleman, Lucretia was raped by Sextus Tarquinius, the son of the Etruscan king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud). After extracting a promise from her father and husband that they would exact revenge on her transgressors, she killed herself. The ensuing outcry and revolt drove the tyrannical Tarquins from Rome, leading to the founding of the Roman Republic. The unknown artist carved Lucretia with a full head of radiant curls and her drapery sliding off her shoulders to reveal her nude body. Despite the small size and shallowness of the relief, the figure has a full-bodied voluptuousness and dynamism. Cameos, hardstones carved in relief, were first explored in antiquity but gained popularity at the sixteenth-century court of Emperor Rudolf II in Prague; the city became famous for the cutting and fashioning of stones. Employing stonecutters from Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany, Rudolf encouraged a cultural renaissance in cameos as well as in other arts. Both the cameo medium and the ancient Roman subject matter reflect the court's great interest in reviving antiquity.
This personification of Charity appropriately distributes purses of alms to a destitute woman and her two naked children. Porcelain sculptures depicting such moralizing subjects were popular during the late 1700s, and the S�vres porcelain manufactory sold many of them. Wealthy Europeans often used these small figural groups to adorn their dining tables.
A fragment from a larger panel or roundel, this detail probably depicts the stoning of the Elders, the last in a series of episodes from the story of the virtuous wife Susanna in the biblical Book of Daniel. It describes the execution of two men who had falsely accused her of infidelity.
Saint Bernard (1090-1153) was the first Abbot of Clairvaux, a Cistercian monastery that he founded in 1116 in northeastern France. Here the abbot is shown standing before a cloth of honor, reading a book and holding a crozier. He is set against a rustic landscape with monastic outbuildings, including a dovecote at the far right. The calm and quotidian activity of monastic life is evoked by the quietness of the scene.
The young haloed figure most likely depicts an angel, prominent auxiliary characters in religious scenes of all media during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. This is one of two similar pieces owned by the museum (Angel). The densely patterned clothing, indicative of expensive fabric, is not unusual for such figures that were often represented in elaborate ecclesiastical or royal garments appropriate to their status as heavenly attendants.
The Virgin Mary, hieratic and still, looks out toward the viewer while gently supporting Christ with her left arm. The smiling infant gazes lovingly toward her and playfully stretches out his arm, grabbing the edge of her gold-trimmed, blue cloak. The star over the Madonna's forehead refers to her title "Star of the Sea," the meaning of the Jewish form of her name, Miriam.The Virgin's rigid and formal pose reflects the icon tradition of the Byzantine Empire. The painting's format and the ornamental scroll on either side of the Madonna also find close parallels in Byzantine icons. But unlike Byzantine work, the Master of Saint Cecilia emphasizes the intimate connection between the Madonna and Child, embodied at the Virgin's breast where her right hand gently cradles Christ's tiny left hand. This humanizing tendency would become increasingly prominent in Western Europe and a hallmark of Renaissance imagery of the Madonna and Child.
This type of jewel was worn as a dress accessory on the turned-back brim of a hat or cap, fastened by a pin or by stitches through metal loops attached to the back. The fashion for wearing hat badges remained in vogue from about the middle of the 1400s to the second half to the 1500s. This piece used a technique known as commesso --referring to the process by which stones were "committed" or attached together like a jigsaw puzzle--that was often used to restore ancient gems. The subject of this badge is the allegorical figure of Prudence, a popular subject during the Renaissance. With Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance, Prudence was one of the four Cardinal Virtues. Signifying wise conduct, she holds a mirror that she uses to see herself truthfully. The jewel was probably intended to be worn by a woman, possibly to invite Prudence's protection or to symbolize the virtues she personifies.
Amid the disarray of Vulcan's forge, Venus leans into the embrace of her lover, Mars, who is transfixed by her alluring gaze. Caught up in his attraction to the aggressively seductive goddess, Mars is no longer able to carry out his military exploits. Venus removes his helmet, while mischievous putti cavort with his sword and shield. In the 1600s, the subject of Venus disarming her lover Mars was understood as an allegory of Peace. Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder's interpretation of the subject, however, emphasizes the fragility of peace. Weapons production continues in the background at the burning fires of Vulcan's hearth, signaling that love's conquest of war may be only temporary. Rubens and Brueghel, who were close colleagues, collaborated on at least twenty-five paintings. This painting displays each virtuoso's talents: Rubens's robust figural style and Brueghel's intricate still life details. The luminous figure of Venus, the reflective quality of the weapons and armor, and the tactile quality of the lush painting testify to their skill.
Saint John the Baptist cradles the Holy Lamb, a symbol of the sacrificial Christ. The sculpture illustrates the saint's exclamation, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). Glimpsed beneath his billowing mantle is a tattered shift of camel's skin, as described in the Bible. The camel's bearded head rests between the saint's feet. Originally the sculpture was one of two figures flanking a central figure of Christ or the Virgin and Child within a winged altarpiece. It has lost most of its original paint.
In this companion piece to the Before [the Seduction], a man stands and hurriedly pulls up his breeches after successfully seducing a young woman. Cap and clothing askew, the disheveled woman implores his discretion. The overturned table and broken mirror symbolize the woman's shattered life now that she has lost her virginity. The dog sleeping in the foreground refers to post-coital exhaustion. In the Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth, published in 1785, John Nichols wrote that a "certain vicious nobleman," the Duke of Montague, supposedly commissioned this painting and its partner. According to an old tradition, the scene's protagonist was said to have been Sir John Willes, later Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Many artists created engravings, some of them scandalous, after these two paintings. Hogarth's own engravings stayed truer to his paintings.
This narrative painting describes the moments before a seduction. A young man in red breeches attempts to pull a young woman onto a bed. Struggling, she tries to push him away, dragging her dressing table down with her. Ironically, an open drawer reveals a book on the rules of courtship. Below, a small dog barks, alarmed by the commotion. In the Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth, published in 1785, John Nichols wrote that a "certain vicious nobleman," the Duke of Montague, supposedly commissioned this painting and its companion, After. According to an old tradition, the protagonist was said to have been Sir John Willes, later Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Many artists made engravings, some of them scandalous, after these paintings. Hogarth's engravings after his own paintings are truer to the originals.
This unusually shaped plate with a small base and wide, sloping sides displays a finely painted close-up portrait of Saint Peter. It is one of very few plates painted with a dramatic close-up bust that covers the entire front surface of the work. The plate's rim inventively forms part of the saint's yellow halo so that the two shapes complement each other. To the right and left of Saint Peter's head are the initials SPfor San Pietro. The saint is shown as if he were earnestly speaking to the viewer as he points to the keys to the kingdom of heaven.
The Virgin Mary tenderly holds Christ on her lap, while the donors who commissioned this panel kneel below them, their eyes raised in reverence. The Christ child meets their gaze as he rewards their piety with a blessing. A fig branch is visible in the frame of the window in the background, a symbol of Christ's resurrection.Lotto divides his composition in two, framing the Virgin and Christ child with swathes of drapery, while the space inhabited by the kneeling couple is distinctly delineated: they are positioned against a wall with a window which opens onto a view of a distant landscape. The appearance of the figures on either side of the composition is characteristically different. The Virgin�s brightly-colored robes contrast with the somber dress of the donors. Lotto has depicted mother and child in twisting, angular poses, with the Madonna balancing in contrapposto, while the kneeling couple are shown in profile, in rigid, upright positions. This division serves to emphasize the contrast between the earthly and the spiritual realms, but might also be explained by the fact that the figures of the Virgin and her son are thought to have been borrowed from a composition by another artist, perhaps someone in the circle of Raphael (1483 � 1520) or Giulio Romano (about 1499 � 1546). The differentiation between the two sets of figures has also led scholars to suggest that this painting demonstrates a transitional phase in Lotto�s work.Donors were frequently portrayed in paintings that they commissioned from the Medieval period onwards. This specific kind of composition, in which kneeling donors are depicted in profile alongside the Virgin and Child was developed by a fellow Venetian artist, Giovanni Bellini (about 1435 � 1516), in the 1490s, and became increasingly popular in the early 1500s. While earlier donor portraits were typically altarpieces, by the fifteenth century such paintings were also commissioned to display in the home or for private chapels. These works served both as portraits of the individuals who funded them, and as testimony to their piety.
The words Ave gratia plena Dominus tecum (Greetings most favored one! The Lord is with you) from Luke 1:8 flow from the archangel Gabriel's mouth as he announces the conception of Christ to the Virgin Mary. Much as in modern comic books, Tommaso del Mazza visualized Gabriel's speech for the viewer to follow along. In Mary's lap the Bible is opened to the prophecy of Isaiah: "Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son..." (Isaiah 7:14). Gently touching her chest, Mary leans forward to acknowledge her destiny. Above, God the Father floats in a mandorla of angels as the dove of the Holy Spirit descends to Mary at the moment of Incarnation.The Annunciation takes place in a spatially ambiguous structure in which Mary appears too large. Tooled haloes, gold, and vivid colors heighten the intensity of the moment and add to the overall impression of sumptuousness.This panel was created by Tommaso del Mazza, until recently known only as the Master of St. Verdiana, who worked in the late Gothic style during the Renaissance in Florence.
Wearing a gold medallion around his neck, an elderly man leans forward and extends a hand towards a youth who sits in front of a book. The man looks neither at the boy nor at the large open volume but instead gazes sympathetically at the viewer. Wearing a laurel wreath upon his head and dressed in a golden yellow robe with a richly embroidered cape, the daydreaming boy stares off into the distance. Jan Lievens, who shared Rembrandt's interest in historical portraits featuring characters in fanciful costumes, here depicted Prince Charles Louis of the Palatinate being taught by his tutor Wolrad von Plessen. Previously thought to be a biblical depiction of Eli instructing Samuel, current research reveals that these figures were meant to allude to the classical figures of Aristotle instructing the young Alexander. Both Prince Charles Louis and Alexander the Great were about fourteen years old when they received instruction from their respective mentors.
In Giovanni Lanfranco's highly original design, a few large figures stand in a shallow foreground space. Using a low viewpoint and dramatic foreshortening, Lanfranco depicted the figures as if seen from below, imbuing them with monumentality. The powerful composition communicated both to spectators standing far away and to viewers standing beneath the painting.In this Old Testament story (1 Kings 17:8-24), the poor widow of Zarephath nourished Elijah in the desert with bread baked from a supply of grain that Elijah had assured her would be miraculously renewed by God. In Catholic theology, the widow's bread prefigured both the bread served at the Last Supper and God's sustenance of each Christian's spirit through the sacrament of the Eucharist.Appropriately, this picture and Moses and the Messengers from Canaan flanked a painting of the Last Supper in the large Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the church of San Paolo fuori le Mura (Saint Paul Outside the Walls) in Rome. Six additional paintings by Lanfranco, all related to the Eucharist, also hung high on the walls of the chapel.
Venus, the goddess of love, and her lover Adonis meet each other's eyes, their bodies still half entwined. Holding his spear, the young mortal Adonis sits upright, anxious to be off to the hunt while his dog waits patiently at his side. Venus touches his shoulder, imploring him not to go. In so doing, she reclines slightly backwards as if to pull him closer. To her left a pair of doves, Venus's attribute, symbolize love and constancy. Paintings like this one were popular with sophisticated art patrons in Paris, where Simon Vouet returned in 1627 after spending years in Rome. He absorbed the lessons of Italian Baroque painting and continued to use bright, decorative colors; Adonis wears a yellow-gold robe over a fuchsia-colored tunic and lavender sandals, and Venus is partially clad in a white undergarment and a subdued violet-blue robe. Her creamy white skin contrasts with the darker, smooth skin of Adonis, here depicted as an adolescent with rosy cheeks and a bud-like mouth.
Lord Bute, who commissioned this portrait as a memento of his son's Grand Tour, was so pleased with it that he paid the artist twice the agreed-upon price. Exuding the self-possessed confidence of a young aristocrat, nineteen-year-old Lord Mountstuart leans against a mantel displaying the utmost in sumptuous French attire: a fur-lined winter suit of turquoise silk, lace collar and cuffs, white silk stockings, and diamond-buckle shoes.Jean-�tienne Liotard depicted the charismatic English nobleman in an elegant setting--a re-creation of a salon in Geneva appointed with Rococo furnishings such as firedogs ornamented with cherubs and a Chinese folding screen used to stop cold drafts. Above the mantel, Liotard depicted Mountstuart's handsome profile and dignified posture in a gilded mirror.Lord Mountstuart, and to a lesser extent his reflection, are sharply depicted and project forward from the surrounding objects, which are blurred to create this optical illusion. This portrait is one of the largest pastels Liotard ever painted and the only one to show a full-length subject in a meticulously described interior. His skillful effects of scale, format, and illusion challenged the conventional medium of oil painting, and Liotard himself considered the work a masterpiece.
This distinguished gentleman does not address the viewer, but gazes out fixedly at a point beyond the frame. The slight turn of head, the pursed lips, and the left hand at his jacket convey a sense of ease, comfort, and confidence. The sitter's dress reinforces his assuredness. The cascading curls of his abundant powdered wig fall below his shoulders. The wig's downward flow is echoed in the turquoise ribbon punctuating his white shirt. The bright blue of the ribbon, as well as the crisp white lace cuff, enliven the muted palette of grays and greens. The simple backdrop, free of furniture or other exterior trappings, ensures that the viewer focuses on the life-size portrait. For many years, this gentleman was believed to be Samuel Bernard, one of the wealthiest financiers in Paris. But comparisons to documented portraits of Bernard suggest that the pastel depicts another sitter, one who has yet to be identified. Given that Joseph Vivien was among France's most sought-after pastel portraitists and commanded high prices for his work, the sitter would certainly have been of significant wealth.
Set against a gold background, the Madonna and Child sit enclosed in a Gothic frame with pointed arches and decorative twisting columns. In this single image, Guariento di Arpo combined three traditional pictorial representations of the Virgin. She sits on the ground nursing the infant Christ as the Madonna of Humility, a representation that emphasizes her role as the compassionate, maternal intercessor for all who pray for Christ's mercy. At the same time, her crown points to her role as the Queen of Heaven. Finally, identified by the golden sun-brooch at her breast and the incised rays that emanate from her, she personifies the apocalyptic woman from the twelfth chapter of the biblical Book of Revelation. Above, a golden aureole of celestial light encloses the blessing figure of God the Father.
Rosalba Carriera played a key role in transforming pastel painting from an amateur pastime into a serious artistic pursuit. Most of her sitters were young tourists, impatient to get back to the manifold sensual pleasures readily available in Venice. By contrast, Sir James Gray, second Baronet (about 1708-1773) was a successful British diplomat and antiquarian living in the city. Carriera thus had the opportunity to get to know him well and study his countenance over repeated sittings, resulting in a penetrating characterization virtually unmatched in her oeuvre. Her meticulous attention to detail is evident in passages such as the strands of chestnut hair emerging from underneath Sir James's powdered wig.
This finely worked and intensely naturalistic drawing belongs to a small but distinct group of red chalk portrait studies of Fra Bartolommeo�s Dominican brothers. These sheets were drawn on a small scale with exquisite skill, the artist stumping and rubbing the chalk to render the facial topography and minutely subtle effects of light. The drawings served the artist in his work on five fresco lunettes depicting Dominican saints, painted over the doors of the visitors� sleeping quarters (the Forestiera) on the ground floor of the convert of San Marco, Florence.
Pluto, god of the Underworld, seizes Proserpine, daughter of Roman goddess of agriculture and fertility, Ceres, and prepares to return with her to his kingdom on a chariot drawn by black horses. According to Ovid's Metamorphoses, Proserpine was forced to live in the underworld for four months of every year; her departure from earth marked the advent of winter, and her return brought about spring and summer.The muscular, marble-like figures illustrate the influence of Michelangelo (1475�1564) on the younger Florentine artist, while their complex, twisted poses and bright, saturated colors reflect that of his adoptive father and master, Bronzino (1503�1572). Painted on a large wood panel, this work was conceived as part of a series of three monumental mythological scenes painted between 1570 and 1572 as decoration for Alamanno Salviati�s villa at Ponte alla Badia near Florence. The accompanying scenes, depicting Aeneas and Anchises and Narcissus, are today located in the residence of the Turkish Ambassador, Washington, D.C.
Two European men in Middle Eastern dress pose in front of a parapet. The bearded man on the left gestures to the right, while the other man looks in the same direction and holds a cryptic message in Italian:  Sig:r mio videte la strade di sa lute per la mano di sweerts  (My Lord, see the way to salvation by the hand of Sweerts). The note's meaning and the identity of the two gentlemen have eluded scholars. The two men appear to be individualized portraits, recalling the tradition of friendship portraits so popular in Northern Europe. The refined execution of this painting is typical of Flemish artist Michael Sweert's late style, practiced when he traveled in India as a missionary. "My Lord," then, may be addressed to the viewer, encouraging him to listen to Sweerts's preaching. With this double portrait, the artist may be urging the observer to find redemption through his belief in God, just as Sweerts did.
In this depiction of the lamentation of Christ, Fernando Gallego looked to Northern European paintings for inspiration but included distinctly Spanish elements such as a subdued palette and unidealized figures. Unlike Netherlandish artists who were interested in depicting the natural world in minute detail, Gallego concentrated on the piet�'s psychological and emotional impact, eliminating extraneous or distracting elements. The Virgin Mary sits in front of the cross, gazing at her dead son in her lap. On the ground around them are several pebbles, a bone, and a skull. A lance and a rod with attached sponge, two instruments from the Passion, lean perfectly vertically against the cross, which is inscribed with the initials i.n.r.i. Behind the cross a rocky landscape overlooks a Gothic walled town, settled between a body of water and verdant countryside that stretches into the far distance. Gallego focused on the moment after the Crucifixion when overwhelming anguish gave way to resigned misery, the sentiment evident in the grief-stricken face of the Virgin, flushed and swollen from weeping. Christ's broken and emaciated body, his eyes unseeing, stretches awkwardly across her lap. Their exaggerated and unidealized features intensify the pathos central to the theme of the piet�.
A bacchante, follower of Bacchus, the god of wine, leans forward and grins at the viewer while squeezing a bunch of grapes into a golden drinking vessel. Her posture, exposed breasts, flushed cheeks, and inviting smile allude to her drunken state. There is something disturbing, however, in the way she provocatively confronts the viewer, leaning into the spectator's space and smiling broadly. In the lower left corner an ape mimics the woman's gesture, holding a smaller bunch of grapes in his right paw. The ape may serve a moralizing purpose, condemning excessive drinking. While visiting Rome from about 1604 to 1614, Hendrick ter Brugghen saw the famous Bacchus by Caravaggio from which this classical painting of Bacchus's female follower derives.
What Pierre-Auguste Renoir himself titled this painting is unknown, but La Promenade is in part an homage to earlier artists whom he greatly admired. Renoir had spent the previous summer painting outdoors with Claude Monet, who encouraged him to move toward a lighter, more luminous palette and to indulge his penchant for luscious, feathery brushwork. Here Renoir retained something of Gustave Courbet's green-and-brown palette while choosing his subject from the sensual, lighthearted garden jaunts of eighteenth-century painters such as Jean-Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honor� Fragonard, whose works he had studied in the Louvre.Unlike the images of seduction created by his predecessors, Renoir's is a fleeting moment caught by chance--middle-class Parisians immersed in nature, possibly a local park, not set before a studio backdrop. The dappled light filtering through the foliage would become a trademark of Renoir's finest Impressionist works of the 1870s and 1880s. He used a thin, oily paint mix, his glazes here floating into each other to create depth.
Gabriel Bernard de Rieux, the youngest son of an immensely successful financier, wears the robes of his office as president of the second Court of Inquiry in the Parliament of Paris. From a large tome held on his lap, he lifts a sheet of paper. Intending to declare the sitter's erudition, wealth, and status, Maurice-Quentin de La Tour placed de Rieux in his study, surrounded by fashionable and expensive objects. Behind him is a richly ornamental screen; on a table covered with blue velvet cloth are books, papers, and an inkstand with a quill pen. A globe stands next to the table and a Turkish carpet covers the floor. These objects identify the sitter as a connoisseur of fine and precious thing--like his father, whose considerable fortune de Rieux inherited the year this portrait was painted. This large, full-length portrait, still in its original, massive gilt frame, was assembled from separate sheets of paper laid on canvas and drawn entirely in pastel. The most sought-after portraitist of his day, La Tour worked exclusively in pastel, producing likenesses of the nobility and the wealthy middle class that were applauded for both their technical mastery and their astonishing verisimilitude. In fact, one contemporary critic marveled that such a work as this portrait could be created using crayons.
In a richly brocaded robe, with rosy cheeks, shining eyes, and outstretched arms, Saint Gin�s de la Jara appeals to the faithful standing before him. His gestures and open mouth suggest that he is preaching. According to legend, after Saint Gin�s was decapitated in southern France, he picked up his head and tossed it into the Rh�ne River. Carried by the sea to the coast of southeastern Spain, it was retrieved and conserved as a relic. Life-sized, devotional cult objects often included glass eyes and were often made out of wood that could be painted in order to achieve lifelike results. Reinforcing the emotional experience of the faithful, such heightened realism typified Spanish Baroque art at a time when the Catholic Church sought to make Christianity more accessible to believers. Luisa Rold�n, also called La Roldana, carved the work. The figure was polychromed by her brother-in-law, Tom�s de los Arcos, who used the Spanish technique of estofado to replicate the brocaded ecclesiastical garments. In this process, the area of the figure's garment was first covered in gold leaf and painted over with brown paint, and then incised with a stylus to reveal the gold underneath.
Facing the viewer, a bearded man in theatrical clothing poses in front of a loosely painted, classicizing backdrop. He holds a sheet of music in his left hand and with his right hand points at an overturned bowl in the foreground, a vanitas symbol that refers to the emptiness of material possessions. Intense eyes set in an expressive face watch the viewer while he gestures. In the lower right-hand corner, two young men, perhaps admirers, watch with interest. The bearded man may have been a singer or actor shown in a role from a play; his informality also suggests that he may have been a friend of the artist, Domenico Fetti.
A landowner and country gentleman, John Whetham of Kirklington poses beside a border collie in front of a rocky background. He wears a green coat, a yellow waistcoat, and a fur hat and sash and holds a hunting spear. This costume, unusual for an Englishman, is a loose adaptation of a Hungarian hussar's military dress. Worn by John Whetham for a ball in 1779, this type of masquerade dress was also fashionable for portraits at the time, both because it forwarded the social aspirations of the English aristocracy and because it was timeless, outlasting changing styles.
Francesco de los Cobos y Molina, the powerful secretary and chief financial advisor to Emperor Charles V, poses in front of a swath of drapery, looking warily out at the viewer. Previously unidentified, two clues have led to Francesco's identification as the portrait's subject: the red cross emblazoned on his doublet and the gem-encrusted jewel in the shape of a scallop shell. Both are emblems of the chivalric Order of Santiago, Saint James the Greater. As an artist to several courts, Jan Gossaert traveled widely throughout Europe and became one of the first painters to disseminate the Italian Renaissance style in the Netherlands. In this painting, Gossaert combines psychological insight, keen observation of form, and a facility for imitating surface textures to create a portrait that is both imposing and believable.
The subject of this tabletop bronze comes from Greek mythology. When the Trojan prince Paris abducted Helen--the beautiful wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta--and carried her off to the city of Troy, the Greeks responded by mounting an attack on the city, thus beginning the Trojan War. Both the bronze's subject--the Trojan War--and its small-scale format reveal the artist's interest in classical culture. The handling of the figures, however, shows the influence of Italian Mannerist sculpture of the 1600s. The sculptor, Giovanni Francesco Susini, welded the three nude figures together in an intensely dramatic composition. While Paris attempts to carry Helen off, she valiantly struggles against him. Below them a female servant protests. The women twist around the central spiral of Paris's lithe body. Susini arranges the figures as if on a stage; both Paris and Helen turn their faces toward the front. Yet, the spiral composition also encourages the viewer to walk around the piece, offering interesting alternate perspectives. From the sides and back, the details of the figures' exertion are visible: as he sinks his fingers into Helen's yielding flesh, the veins on Paris's hands project and Helen's hair flies loose.
In a richly brocaded robe, with rosy cheeks, shining eyes, and outstretched arms, Saint Gines de la Jara appeals to the faithful standing before him. His gestures and open mouth suggest that he is preaching. According to legend, after Saint Gines was decapitated in southern France, he picked up his head and tossed it into the Rha ne River. Carried by the sea to the coast of southeastern Spain, it was retrieved and conserved as a relic. Life-sized, devotional cult objects often included glass eyes and were often made out of wood that could be painted in order to achieve lifelike results. Reinforcing the emotional experience of the faithful, such heightened realism typified Spanish Baroque art at a time when the Catholic Church sought to make Christianity more accessible to believers.
Th�odore G�ricault's only known erotic painting, this small oil sketch depicts two lovers locked in a passionate embrace while their languid companion calmly watches from the left. The woman's nudity and relaxed pose evoke the classical tradition of representing repose after lovemaking, a tradition that is also evoked by the way her voluptuous figure complements the statue of Venus above. Encoiled in her lover's arms and with her legs provocatively exposed, the woman in white is an active participant in the amorous act rather than a passive object. With a modern directness, G�ricault captured the intensity and energy of human sexuality in a manner very different from the idealizing conventions of his age. G�ricault 's expressive handling of line and paint accords with the passionate energy of the subject matter. Despite the small size and sketchy nature of this painting, G�ricault made it as an independent work of art, intended for close private viewing.
Bernardo Cavallino depicts an episode from the Bible in which King Saul, about to enter into battle with the Philistines, asked the Witch of Endor to summon the spirit of the recently deceased prophet Samuel, the last Judge of the Israelites. Silhouetted against a bright light emanating from a nearby doorway, Samuel's skin appears suitably ashen and gray. He engages the kneeling king with a penetrating stare, and delivers news that the next day the Philistines will defeat Israel and that Saul and his sons will die in battle. Cavallino eloquently conveys the emotional interaction among the three figures as Samuel relays this news.The smooth, uniform surface of the painting�s copper support facilitated the application of paint in fine brushstrokes, as evidenced by carefully delineated contours and minute details, like the individual wisps of hair in Saul�s beard. Little is known about the artist�s life and work, but he is recognized for small-scale narrative compositions on copper and canvas, such as this one. Cavallino�s initials are included on a stone step to the left of the composition, making it one of only eight signed works by the Neapolitan artist.This painting is said to be one of a group of four copper panels which were perhaps commissioned for a single recipient, which include Cavallino�s Mucius Scaevola Confronting King Porsenna in the Kimbell Museum, Forth Worth, and Andrea Vaccaro�s (1604�1670) Jonah Preaching at Nineveh, Museo de Bellas Artes, Seville. The fourth work, of unknown subject and authorship, is now considered lost, but the group may have included The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple, Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow.
Three anonymous artists illuminated this book of hours for a wealthy bourgeois woman, about whom scholars know little besides that she was probably named Margaret. The book typifies those coveted by middle-class women in Europe in the early 1400s. A medieval poet mocked this materialism, referring specifically to such books: "A book of hours, too, must be mine, just as a nobleman desires. Let it be splendidly crafted in gold and azure, luxurious and elegant." A book of hours contains prayers designed for laypeople and organized for private recitation at the eight canonical hours of the Church day. As the poet noted, the materials and decoration were as important as the textual contents. This luxuriously designed book contains seventeen three-quarter-page miniatures and twelve quarter-page miniatures, all on pages with delicate, leafy borders. The artists used expensive pigments and achieved an extremely high level of artistic refinement that undoubtedly dazzled the client.
A crowd of Israelites gathers to observe a dramatic Old Testament miracle. After they wandered in the wilderness of the Sinai Desert without water, God saved them by instructing Moses to strike a rock with his staff, whereupon fresh water gushed out.Jacob Jordaens conveyed the scene's drama through energetic motion and repetition. Using a characteristically Baroque sweeping horizontal composition, he effortlessly interwove human figures and animals into a frieze that follows from left to right, from anticipation--with jars and drinking vessels at the ready--to Moses' theatrical gesture. The figures' proportions and subtle foreshortening indicate that Jordaens intended the picture to be viewed from below.Here Jordaens repeated a subject he had first attempted nearly three decades earlier, following his usual practice of reworking ideas and finding new solutions. As here, the devoted Calvinist Jordaens often made instructive, rather than devotional, religious pictures.
Against an architectural backdrop, Mary Magdalene becomes the first witness to Christ's Resurrection. Since he had not yet ascended to heaven, Jesus instructed her not to touch him (Noli me tangere in Latin) and asked her to go to his disciples with the message that he had risen (John 20:11-18). Alessandro Magnasco filled this tall canvas with picturesque classical ruins, whose shapes echo the curves of the figures' theatrical poses. His energetic brushwork, nervous, sketchy style, and lively approach create around the risen Christ a flurry of drapery that seems to have a life of its own, adding to the drama of the miraculous event.
Just finishing a Sunday meal, the members of this well-to-do family may be getting ready to return to church. The mother hands a prayer book to the younger of the boys, and the little girl holds her freshly starched cap and fan. Quiringh Gerritsz. van Brekelenkam appears to have combined a family portrait and a genre scene with a moralizing message.Van Brekelenkam emphasized the moral message by placing a large, framed landscape in the background above the mantel. As the family displays domestic virtues, the painting within the painting shows a couple gazing at a ship at sea under a dark sky illuminated by a shaft of light. The painting within their home serves as a reminder to the family to look to the light as they continue on life's uncertain voyage.
This finely painted work depicts the Annunciation: the Archangel Gabriel announcing to the Virgin Mary that she has been chosen to become the mother of Christ. In a rather personal interpretation of the theme, Godfried Schalcken represented Mary as a young Dutch woman in contemporary dress, holding a loose scroll rather than the traditional book. The swirling clouds at his knees, the pointing gesture, and the bright light around the angel's head betray Gabriel's spiritual status, for he has no wings or traditional symbols to identify him as God's messenger. Bright light illuminates Mary's thoughtful face. Schalcken delicately manipulated light and shadow to describe the folds in Gabriel's white gown and the shadows cast by his outstretched right arm and tilted head. The small size, high degree of finish, and unconventional treatment of the subject matter indicate that the painting was intended for private devotion.
Antoine Singlin fixes the viewer with a steady, piercing gaze. Before his excommunication in 1661, Singlin served as confessor both to Louis XIV, King of France and the philosopher Blaise Pascal. He was also director of Royal-des-Champs and Port-Royal-de-Paris, convents at the center of the severely ascetic religious movement known as Jansenism. This psychologically penetrating study captures the fierce personality of the man and his austere beliefs. Philippe de Champaigne placed Singlin in half-length format against a neutral background, leaving the viewer little choice but to meet Singlin's direct stare.
Taking advantage of the speed with which he could model the soft material of terracotta, the sculptor fashioned an informal and spontaneous portrait bust. He rendered the sitter's face--where the sitter's character is most fully revealed--with great care, while the clothes, hair, and especially the back of the head were treated more sketchily. These areas show the sculptor's handling of the clay, creating incised lines on the front of the clothes and smooth planes on the cheeks.Made to adorn a French interior, this type of bust was very popular in the 1700s. Because terracotta was relatively inexpensive, both middle class and wealthy consumers could purchase artworks made of this material for their homes.
A young woman with a sensually curved figure and a lovely, gentle face represents Hope. With her traditional attribute of an anchor, she nurses a winged Cupid, personifying Love. A common figure from antique sculpture, he has dropped his bow and arrows below him on the rock as he reaches up to nurse. Sculptor Jean-Jacques Caffieri inscribed the title of his marble on the base: Hope Nourishes Love. Hope's nursing breast is a familiar symbol of sustenance and comfort. Allegories of love and friendship were favorite subjects in sculpture and painting around the 1750s, providing sculptors with a noble conceit that encouraged a contrast between the platonic ideals of love and its earthly, sensual elements. The sensual tone of this work is characteristic of the Rococo style fashionable at the French court of Louis XV.
The nude chubby boy standing on a convex base, the crowning figure of an altar complex in the church of San Giacomo di Rialto in Venice, was probably intended to represent the Christ child. In his left hand the child once held an attribute that might have revealed his identity. Considering his open gesture, which closely resembles the pose of Christ blessing, the missing object may have been a cross, a globe, or a crown. The sculpture was cast in one piece using the lost wax process. As in his other works, the sculptor Girolamo Campagna conveyed a sense of movement through the organization of the figure's body. The boy's torso twists gently while his arms and legs move in opposite directions, suggesting motion rather than a static pose. In contrast to the body's sensuous modeling, especially at the hips, thighs and ankles, the boy's face is defined by the smooth planes of his high forehead and heavy-lidded eyes.
Rising from a rounded socle, Alexis-Jean-Eustache Taitbout's head turns. A relaxed smile softens his bulbous features, and his eyes are sparkling and alive. His prominent nose, furrowed forehead, bushy eyebrows, and soft, aging flesh suggest a sympathetic, kind disposition. To suggest informality, Jean-Jacques Caffieri left the surface rough and rendered the sitter in casual garb. Caffieri, who was known for his portrait busts of contemporary celebrities, especially those of writers and artists, represented Taitbout as one of the literati, even outfitting him in the loose blouse worn by artists and writers. He modeled the bust in terracotta, taking advantage of the medium's flexibility to render a portrait striking in its spontaneity. The intimacy of this portrait is characteristic of the Enlightenment interest in psychology. Indeed, the portrait's psychological penetration suggests that the sitter or a close intimate probably commissioned it. Taitbout was an aristocrat, a knight of the order of Saint-Lazare, who served as French general consul to Alger, Algeria and then to Naples. The sculptor likely modeled the portrait from life and chose to memorialize Taitbout's warm humanity.
William Burton Conyngham, a young Irish aristocrat, likely commissioned this pastel portrait as a souvenir of his Grand Tour. Though Conyngham is depicted as a distinguished gentleman, his open and eager expression conveys a sense of spontaneity appropriate to his youth. The artist, Anton Raphael Mengs, was renowned for his ability to achieve in pastels the effect of the strong saturated colors and highlights characteristic of oil painting. This is evident in the luxurious velvet cloak, which is cut off at the picture's edge to emphasize its volume and richness. The light reflecting on Conyngham's nose and lips and the wet appearance of the eyes further mimics the effect of oil paint.
John Russell's engaging portrait of George de Ligne Gregory was likely painted to celebrate Gregory's appointment as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1793. Gregory, the holder of Harlaxton Manor, is shown wearing the sober, sensible garments typical of a nobleman in the early 1790s: a brown double-breasted wool coat with black collar set against a brilliant white linen cravat. In his hand he casually holds a black hat lined with glowing white satin. Gregory's hat and collar are covered with white powder from his fashionably dressed hair. He is somberly yet richly dressed, alert yet seated at ease. Gregory's decorous pose embodies Russell's ideal of depicting the sitter in a manner appropriate to his age. The portrait's brilliant whites, velvety blacks, and masterful interplay of varied flesh tones with blues are all characteristics of Russell's virtuoso application of pastel. Russell achieved the even tonality by manually smudging broad, soft areas of crayon onto the paper. He then applied fine, linear flourishes, such as the white highlighting on the cravat and in the hat lining, with a hard, pointed crayon. Russell's technical facility and acute powers of observation resulted in an engaging representation of the sitter.
Depicted three-quarter length, the Earl of Arundel sits before a tapestry curtain on the left and a landscape background on the right. The long, tapering fingers of his left hand hold the gold medallion of Saint George, one of the emblems worn by the twenty-four knights who made up the most eminent and noble circle around the king. His elongated, pale face contrasts with the white ruff around his neck and the scarlet chair upon which he sits. Turned slightly towards the viewer, the expression on Arundel's face is alert but reserved. Arundel was one of the great patrons and collectors of art in England in the early 1600s. He was best known for his collection of Venetian paintings, which included works by Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese. During a brief first visit to London around 1621, Anthony van Dyck was commissioned to paint this portrait for Arundel, who recognized the young artist's talent.
The painting's subject comes from the Old Testament: the first book of Samuel, which describes the turning point in David's relationship with King Saul. The priest Ahimelech gives the sword of Goliath to the young David, who won it in battle. When King Saul learned that this symbol of power had been given to David, he had Ahimelech murdered. The sleeve and headdress of the priest Ahimelech reveal scratches and uneven working of the pigment so it catches the light in vivid contrasting highlights. Aert de Gelder made these scratches with a paint knife or the end of a brush, which he often used to highlight the paint surface. De Gelder was a pupil of Rembrandt, and the influence of Rembrandt's late style is evident in his choice of half-length, life-size figures, muted colors, and expressive brushstrokes.
Turning to the viewer with a sidelong glance and wearing an enigmatic expression, a young woman plays the lute. A skillfully-rendered sheer veil covers her wavy hair and intricate embroidery and jeweled trimming lines the bodice and sleeves of her green velvet gown. The music notes transcribed in the book below her follow some kind of comprehensive melody, but not one which can be identified with a known piece of music. The identity of the lady is unknown�this may be a portrait of a private client (the artist specialized in such commissions) or is perhaps a demonstration of the artist�s ability to describe beauty and luxurious textiles.This painting belongs to a series of works by Bartolomeo Veneto, which depict an unidentified female sitter playing a lute. Other similar compositions exist in which the lute has been replaced by a wheel, transforming the lady into Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The prime or original version of this composition is not readily identifiable within the group. Scholars have theorized that these portraits, all of which are unsigned, may have been copied from an unknown source, perhaps an earlier work by Bartolomeo himself, or a fifteenth century prototype. Bartolomeo�s lutenist portraits recall the female models of Leonardo da Vinci (1452 � 1519), to whom this painting was ascribed in the nineteenth century. Further association with Leonardo is created by the presence of a creature draped across the crook of the lady�s left arm�reminiscent of the ermine in Leonardo�s portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, known as Lady with the Ermine, now in the National Museum, Krakow. The animal in Bartolomeo�s painting is not, however, a live ermine as in Leonardo�s painting, but a dead one. The so-called zibellino, or flea pelt, was a sable fur frequently worn by high-ranking women in sixteenth century portraits and believed to repel fleas.
The boar was furiously twisting its body round and round, its jaws slavering with foam and fresh blood...the hero who had dealt the wound came up close to the animal and roused his foe to fury, before finally burying his shining spear in its shoulder.--Ovid, Metamorphoses Wrapped in a flowing red cape, the warrior Meleager thrusts his spear into the shoulder of a massive boar. The ferocious creature--seemingly undaunted by a pair of hounds latched onto its bristled hide--has turned to confront head-on its human adversary. Meleager's blow will prove to be fatal to the boar, but the beast has proven itself as a fearsome foe. Beneath its imposing hooves lie the disemboweled carcass of a hound and the prostrate corpse of the hunter Ancaeus.The story of the Calydonian boar hunt was told and retold during antiquity--most famously in Ovid's Metamorphoses. When King Oeneus of Calydon failed to honor the goddess Diana with offerings, she released a terrifying boar on his land. The king's son, Meleager, assembled a group of renowned warriors to slay the beast. Several of the huntsmen were killed or maimed before Meleager finally defeated the boar. He presented its head as a trophy to his beloved, the huntress Atalanta, who is seen behind Meleager, with bow in hand.Peter Paul Rubens created this painting a few years after an extended stay in Italy. He drew from ancient sarcophagi and statues he had seen there for the poses of many of the figures. For example, the boar seen in profile was taken directly from a well-known marble in Florence's Uffizi Gallery. Rubens's appropriation of iconic images from antiquity was intended to resonate with learned viewers. For the figures on horseback, Rubens borrowed from his Renaissance predecessors, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. But Rubens's dynamic and inventive interpretation of the hunt was wholly his own. With this painting, he established the theme of the epic combat between man and animal, a subject to which he would return throughout his career.
Separated into two zones with allegorical figures in the foreground and historical figures in the background, Peter Paul Rubens here commemorated the meeting of King Ferdinand III of Hungary and the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand at N�rdlingen on the Danube River on September 2, 1634. Four days later, the two Catholic rulers would combine their armies to win an important victory over Protestant forces. At the upper right, the Cardinal-Infante solemnly greets his cousin Ferdinand. Rubens made this freely drawn oil sketch as a modello for the right panel of the great Stage of Welcome, a monumental canvas that decorated a triumphal arch erected for the ceremonial entry into Antwerp of the newly appointed governor of the southern Netherlands, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Spain. In the foreground, allegorical figures comment on the significance of the event. At the left a naiad or water nymph rests her arm on the personification of the River Danube, who sits on a urn flowing with blood and water while extending his left arm in a gesture of welcome. Kneeling at the right, the figure of Germania, dressed in black, rests her head on her hand. She gazes mournfully at the viewer while a winged genius draws her attention to the meeting behind her.
The sea god Glaucus pulls aside his beard, revealing Cupid's arrow protruding from his chest. Looking up, he sees the maiden Scylla on a rocky cliff and pronounces his love for her. Laurent de La Hyre represented a romantic scene from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Glaucus rises from the sea with an elegant, curling white beard, a muscular torso, and a scaly tail that unwinds among the reeds. Clad only in crumpled white and red drapery gathered around her waist, Scylla leans forward, gesturing with her hand. Behind her, Cupid looks ready to let loose another arrow. La Hyre used soft pinks in the sky and delicate hues of blue in the water, in contrast to the vivid green used for the reeds and foliage. The painting was intended as a design for a tapestry series woven by the Gobelins factories and representing the loves of the gods.
In the Metamorphoses, the Roman poet Ovid described how nymphs bathed Diana, the goddess of the hunt, in a stream of clear water. Jean-Fran�ois de Troy portrayed the moment after the bath when the nymphs are drying Diana's body and refastening her tunic. To the left, a nymph attempts to shield Diana's nudity from a lecherous river god's sight. De Troy's choice of subject matter and the description of the women's flesh--creamy white with a pink blush tint--give this painting an erotic charge. The river god, watching the scene voyeuristically from the side, becomes a stand-in for the viewer. De Troy used a warm palette of autumnal and pastel colors to describe the surrounding foliage and sky. Layers of glazes intensify the glowing tones.
With cherubic red checks, rich locks of curls, and folds of baby fat, the polychromed life-size wood statue of the nude Christ Child would have appealed to his audience. The child balances on a rocky landscape, his cape billowing around his shoulders. In his hand he may have once held a globe referring to his role as Salvator Mundi, the Savior of the World, or grapes, referring to his sacrifice on the cross. The nude Christ Child was a popular subject in European wood sculpture beginning in the 1300s. Theologians of this period understood Jesus's nudity as a sign of his human nature. During the 1500s and 1600s, Saint Ignatius Loyola and Saint Anthony of Padua further encouraged devotion to the humanity of Christ. This figure is a high Baroque version of the popular theme, full of animation and theatricality. The fully carved-in-the-round statue was probably designed as a devotional image for an oratory, chapel, or church. It may also have been carried in religious processions or other spectacles of civic life, which were often staged by confraternities.
Oblivious to his cluttered surroundings, the unkempt figure of an alchemist sits among a chaotic jumble of paraphernalia. He holds a scale while weighing out a substance for one of his experiments in making gold. By the seventeenth century, alchemy was no longer considered to be a respectable science, and its practitioners were often the subject of ridicule. In this genre scene, Cornelis Bega commented on time wasted on materialistic and futile pursuits. Like other Dutch artists of his time, Bega was a close observer of natural appearances. Textures and surfaces of the assorted cracked clay and glass vessels are accurately described. Light pouring in through the open window and the harmonious tones of brown, gray, and blue give the painting a cozy warmth.
While performing mass one day, Pope Gregory became aware of a disbeliever in the congregation and prayed for a sign that would leave no doubt about the real presence of Christ in the Mass. Christ materialized above the altar as the Man of Sorrows, displaying the stigmata and surrounded by the instruments and symbols of his Passion. The first amongst the celebrants to perceive the vision, Gregory kneels in reverence and gazes up intently, hands spread, while those around him remain as yet unaware of the miracle.A master in the Bruges painters� and saddlemakers� guild in 1510, Adriaen Ysenbrandt may have trained or associated with the workshop of the Bruges painter Gerard David (about 1460 � 1523). One of the most impressive of the number of small panels attributed to Ysenbrandt, The Mass of Saint Gregory the Great exhibits the distinctive combination of softly rendered heads, magnificent glittering draperies and metalwork, and elaborate architectural decoration characteristic of painting in the Netherlands after 1500 that are the hallmarks of his manner.
Jacques-Andr�-Joseph Aved created a sense of immediacy by depicting Marc de Villiers, a high government official to the court of Louis XV, leaning slightly forward while fixing the spectator with an intense gaze. Next to him an ornate desk is covered with parliamentary and state papers. Grasping the arm of the chair as if about to rise, Villiers holds a copy of Homer's Iliad in his right hand, giving the impression that he has been interrupted while reading. By appearing in his study and in casual dress, the sitter presents himself not only as a high-ranking official but also as a gentleman scholar.
This painting depicts the heavenly vision of Saint Francis of Paola (1416�1507), founder of the Order of Minims, a religious order committed to perpetual abstinence and acts of humility. The saint experiences a vision in which the word �Charitas� (meaning Charity) appears in an aureole of golden light, accompanied by cherubs. The word became the motto of the Minims, and appears on the order�s heraldic crest.In the background, the saint appears again standing on a shore with two kneeling companions. This scene in the distance refers to a miracle in which Francis calmed a stormy sea and ferried the men across the Straits of Messina on his cloak after they had been refused passage on a ship.The subject of the painting should not be considered simply in terms of its visionary and narrative elements, but as a representation of faith itself as embodied by Saint Francis of Paola. Elderly and bearded, he is humbly dressed and appears to bear the weight of his calling on his slender walking staff. He gazes at the message borne aloft by the heavenly host with a look of reverent awe and dutiful acceptance. The simplicity of setting, sober tonality, loose brushwork, and harmony of both material and divine presence, are all consistent with Murillo's late style and help to convey a scene of passionate spiritual appeal.
In this depiction of a meeting between the young Christ and Saint John the Baptist, Guido Reni eliminated unnecessary detail and concentrated on the scene's emotional qualities. The eyes of the two children meet as Mary looks on. The doves that the Christ Child gives to his cousin are an allusion to both Jesus's future role as the King of Peace as well as his eventual sacrifice. Joseph enters through a doorway in the background. Although using oil, Reni applied his color with the broad brushwork of fresco painting. He outlined important details with dark, jagged strokes. It was once thought that the sketchy appearance of Reni's late works meant that they were unfinished, but like many aging artists, Reni pared form and color to the bare essentials for purely expressive purposes. Lost for centuries, this painting reappeared in the possession of a family in Michigan who sold it to the Getty Museum in 1984.
Although the identity of the sitter in this portrait is a mystery, Edgar Degas conveyed her character by capturing the overwhelming sorrow to which she has succumbed. Posed with her head tilted and leaning against the back of her left hand, she appears weary. Her languorous expression and red-rimmed eyes, together with the limp right arm hanging at her side, suggest a physical or emotional malady, though nothing in the painting confirms the cause of her affliction. Hidden beneath a brown robe and full white gown, her pose is ambiguous; it is unclear if she sits, stands, or leans. The Convalescent attests to Degas's interest in the world of women--their physical characteristics and surroundings, and their complex emotional and psychological conditions. Unlike traditional nineteenth-century portraits, which were commissioned and usually left the artist's studio upon completion, this depiction of an unidentified woman remained in Degas's studio for at least fifteen years. The painting is unconventional in other ways as well; The Convalescent is more psychologically suggestive and spatially ambiguous than typical portraits of the time, such as Franz Xaver Winterhalter's official portrait, Leonilla, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn. Degas's thick, unblended brushstrokes and flattened space bring the figure forward, conveying informality and intimacy.
I saw our Lord fastened upon the cross coming down towards me and surrounding me with a marvelous light� Then there came down from the holes of his blessed wounds five bloody beams, which were directed towards the same parts of my body: to my hands, feet, and heart.This was how, according to her biographer, Saint Catherine of Siena described receiving the stigmata. In this panel by Domenico Beccafumi, Catherine is shown kneeling in a small chapel while members of her order wonder what is overtaking her, since only she can see the miraculous vision before her. Another woman sits on the stairs, either asleep or lost in meditation. An altarpiece showing the Nativity is in the background.Beccafumi effectively relates the story with minimal detail. He uses a striking pose to demonstrate the ecstasy of the saint: she bends forward as if to meet the tilting crucifix, her arms outstretched to receive the stigmata. The small panel and its companion, The Miraculous Communion of Saint Catherine of Siena, were probably made for the predella of an altarpiece dedicated to Saint Catherine.
This small panel depicts an episode from the life of the Dominican tertiary and mystic, Saint Catherine of Siena, as described in her biography of 1385, written by her confessor, Raymond of Capua. Receiving the sacrament of Communion gave Saint Catherine visions and ecstasies that lasted hours and left her physically exhausted. Stricken with illness and bedridden, her companions convinced her to not attend church. Catherine acquiesced but prayed for God�s help in receiving the Eucharist. Miraculously, an angel delivered a piece of the consecrated host to the saint. Celebrating Mass at a side altar, Raymond of Capua looks around with concern for the piece of the Host which has mysteriously vanished, while an apparition of the saint, unseen by the surrounding people, receives communion from an angel above.Saint Catherine was revered in the artist�s native Siena, having ministered to the city�s poor and selflessly nursed victims of the 1374 plague. This panel and its companion, Saint Catherine of Siena Receiving the Stigmata, were probably made for the predella of an altarpiece dedicated to the saint.
Madame Bonnier de la Mosson, a member of Parisian society whose literary salon was a popular meeting place for the most noted people of her day, appears as Diana, goddess of the moon, the forest, and the hunt. Jean-Marc Nattier depicted her seated in front of a dramatic sky and barren landscape, delicately holding a bow and arrow, wearing a revealing white chemise low on her shoulders, and wrapped in an exotic leopard skin. In eighteenth-century France it was fashionable for aristocratic women to have their likenesses made in the guise of mythological or historical roles. Nattier, one of the leading portraitists of his day, specialized in these flattering allegorical portraits. During his career, he painted portraits of most of the circle of Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour in either traditional or allegorical guise.
Seated with her hands crossed in her lap, Isabella of Portugal, the duchess of Burgundy, conveys the poise and confidence of her noble position. Her sumptuous attire, heavily woven with gold thread, and her jeweled fingers and headdress reflect her aristocratic status. Oddly, the artist did not match the patterns of the sleeves, as would have been customary during this period. In fact, the duchess never actually sat for this portrait, which may account for the misunderstood representation of her clothing. Scholars believe that the artist copied Isabella's likeness from a lost portrait by Rogier van der Weyden. The tender, slightly mocking expression on the duchess's face and the elongated fingers reflect van der Weyden's concept of portraiture. The prominent inscription in the upper left corner of the panel, PERSICA SIBYLLA IA, suggests that the portrait was part of a series depicting sibyls. This identity strikingly contrasts with Duchess Isabella's costume. Scholars believe that someone other than the original artist added the inscription, as well as the brown background meant to simulate wood, some time after the portrait was painted.
Saint Sebastian is more conventionally depicted bound to a tree or pillar and pierced by arrows, or having his wounds tended to by Irene. Having recovered from the attempted execution by arrows, Roman Emperor Diocletian ordered that he be beaten to death and disposed of in the sewer. The denial of burial demonstrated the utmost contempt for fundamental Christian rites.  Ludovico Carracci here chose to represent the moment when Roman soldiers dumped the saint�s limp body into the ancient sewage system, the Cloaca Maxima, thereby reducing a heroic martyr to a worthless corpse.In 1612 Cardinal Maffeo Barberini commissioned this painting for a subterranean family chapel in the Church of Sant�Andrea della Valle in Rome. The church stood on the site where Saint Sebastian's body was recovered from a drain, the Euripus Agrippae. In a letter to his brother, Cardinal Barberini relayed his concerns that Carracci�s blunt naturalistic portrayal of the saint�s corpse was improper for its intended setting fearing that it would �not inspire much devotion�. Nevertheless, he appreciated the painting as a �good representation of brute force�, and opted not to display it in the chapel, but to keep it for his own private collection.Sebastian is the patron saint of the plague-stricken, and was therefore a popular subject both in the artist�s hometown of Bologna, as well as in Rome, since both cities suffered devastating outbreaks of disease during the century previous. The relentless naturalism displayed in this painting, though shocking to Carracci�s patron, became a definitive feature of the newly-emerging seicento art.
This crowded and colorful panel displays the story of Christ's Crucifixion along with episodes of damnation and salvation. At the left, Christ carries the cross and Veronica hands him her veil. In the center, Christ's broken body hangs on the cross between the two thieves. At the base of the cross, the Virgin Mary swoons as Saint John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene try to assist her. Next to them, greedy soldiers throw dice to determine who will get Christ's robes. At the top right, a voracious monster devours souls, while other souls boil to death in the fiery caldron. Below, Christ descends into Limbo to rescue Adam and Eve. This complex narrative was once the central panel of a portable, three-part altarpiece devoted to Christ's Passion.
Elegance, sophistication, and worldliness define this portrayal of Mary, Joseph, and the Christ Child. Embedded in a fantastic cityscape with an elaborate fountain, the half-hidden figure of Joseph draws the viewer's attention, as do the lilies symbolizing the Virgin's purity in the right foreground. Contemporary taste in Antwerp and Brussels, where this painting was probably made, demanded that nearly every inch of a picture be filled with activity or ornament and that it be as ornate and decorative as possible. Even Mary's headdress provided an opportunity for an eye-catching, energetic shape fluttering against the flowering vines. Jan Gossaert set the figures in an inventive complex of pseudo-antique architecture, indicating his general awareness of Italian styles, probably gained through prints from Italy, which often circulated in Northern Europe, rather than from actual experience.
Maria Cerri Capranica is dressed in a velvet gown with an elaborate lace collar, clothing befitting a young noblewoman. Her elegant outfit is complemented by an array of jewelry--a long strand of pearls, a necklace set with precious stones, a pendant with a small relief of the Holy Family, and pearl drop earrings. The sitter was clearly a woman of status and affluence, and the sculptor depicted her with a powerful and distinctive psychological presence.The fine details of the sitter's costume, jewelry, and hairstyle display a true mastery of marble carving. Cerri's intricate coiffure--a mass of curls ornamented with loops of satiny ribbon--falls gracefully around her face. Algardi sculpted the delicate lace mantle in low relief with subtle contours that reveal how the garment fell around the sitter's shoulders. The strand of pearls, which weaves across the sitter's chest and around her sash, is carved entirely in the round. The attention given to her lace and jewelry makes this as much a portrait of her accessories as of the subject herself.Married in 1637, Maria Cerri and Bartolomeo Capranica were from prominent Roman families. A coat of arms identifying both families appears at the base of the sculpture. Cerri died at the age of twenty-five in 1643.
Four seated women representing water, air, earth, and fire are surrounded by a lush landscape. The fish flowing from the water jug and the cornucopia of abundance cradled in the arms of the figure on the right correspond to the tactile elements of water and earth. The birds in the sky and trees and the accoutrements of battle in the foreground correspond to the intangible elements of fire and air. The figures, the still life objects, and the landscape work together as a unified scene, yet two different artists worked to create this painting. Frequent collaborators, the skilled figure painter Frans Francken II painted the women and background figures, and Jan Brueghel the Younger described the landscape. Such collaboration between artists was common in Antwerp during the 1600s, as artists often specialized in either landscape or figure painting. Flemish artists of the time repeatedly painted representations of the four elements, suggesting that it was a popular subject with buyers. The widely admired Brueghel the Younger depicted the senses, the elements, or the seasons as allegories many times throughout his career, either together or individually, as in the pendant to this painting, Landscape with Ceres (Allegory of Earth).
Dramatically lit and heroically isolated, a Moroccan horseman, fist upraised, charges across a ford, his horse rearing as it gains the riverbank. Behind them stretches an expansive plain where another lone horseman gallops towards a military encampment. The two rearing horses echo each other, just as the foremost horse's tail repeats the form of the weeds on the riverbank. In the background, under a turbulent sky, lies a chain of dark mountains. Delacroix drew inspiration for this painting from his 1832 trip to Morocco, during which he feverishly took notes and made countless sketches and watercolors. The horsemen he encountered in Morocco were among his favorite subjects. As his writings attest, Delacroix saw in them a living incarnation of the noble of spirit and terrible strength of will that he associated with the heroes of antiquity. He designed this small-scale painting for private contemplation, signaling a general retreat into a more subjective realm of exoticism and fantasy.

In a letter to his brother, Cardinal Barberini relayed his concerns that Carracci�s blunt naturalistic portrayal of the saint�s corpse was improper for its intended setting fearing that it would �not inspire much devotion�. Nevertheless, he appreciated the painting as a �good representation of brute force�, and opted not to display it in the chapel, but to keep it for his own private collection.Sebastian is the patron saint of the plague-stricken, and was therefore a popular subject both in the artist�s hometown of Bologna, as well as in Rome, since both cities suffered devastating outbreaks of disease during the century previous. The relentless naturalism displayed in this painting, though shocking to Carracci�s patron, became a definitive feature of the newly-emerging seicento art.
This crowded and colorful panel displays the story of Christ's Crucifixion along with episodes of damnation and salvation. At the left, Christ carries the cross and Veronica hands him her veil. In the center, Christ's broken body hangs on the cross between the two thieves. At the base of the cross, the Virgin Mary swoons as Saint John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene try to assist her. Next to them, greedy soldiers throw dice to determine who will get Christ's robes. At the top right, a voracious monster devours souls, while other souls boil to death in the fiery caldron. Below, Christ descends into Limbo to rescue Adam and Eve. This complex narrative was once the central panel of a portable, three-part altarpiece devoted to Christ's Passion.
Elegance, sophistication, and worldliness define this portrayal of Mary, Joseph, and the Christ Child. Embedded in a fantastic cityscape with an elaborate fountain, the half-hidden figure of Joseph draws the viewer's attention, as do the lilies symbolizing the Virgin's purity in the right foreground. Contemporary taste in Antwerp and Brussels, where this painting was probably made, demanded that nearly every inch of a picture be filled with activity or ornament and that it be as ornate and decorative as possible. Even Mary's headdress provided an opportunity for an eye-catching, energetic shape fluttering against the flowering vines. Jan Gossaert set the figures in an inventive complex of pseudo-antique architecture, indicating his general awareness of Italian styles, probably gained through prints from Italy, which often circulated in Northern Europe, rather than from actual experience.
Maria Cerri Capranica is dressed in a velvet gown with an elaborate lace collar, clothing befitting a young noblewoman. Her elegant outfit is complemented by an array of jewelry--a long strand of pearls, a necklace set with precious stones, a pendant with a small relief of the Holy Family, and pearl drop earrings. The sitter was clearly a woman of status and affluence, and the sculptor depicted her with a powerful and distinctive psychological presence.  The fine details of the sitter's costume, jewelry, and hairstyle display a true mastery of marble carving. Cerri's intricate coiffure--a mass of curls ornamented with loops of satiny ribbon--falls gracefully around her face. Algardi sculpted the delicate lace mantle in low relief with subtle contours that reveal how the garment fell around the sitter's shoulders. The strand of pearls, which weaves across the sitter's chest and around her sash, is carved entirely in the round. The attention given to her lace and jewelry makes this as much a portrait of her accessories as of the subject herself.  Married in 1637, Maria Cerri and Bartolomeo Capranica were from prominent Roman families. A coat of arms identifying both families appears at the base of the sculpture. Cerri died at the age of twenty-five in 1643.
The identity of this man is a mystery. At one point, scholars believed the painting may to be a self-portrait, but such speculation remains unconfirmed, since the sitter�s facial features differ somewhat from Veronese�s early self-portrait at the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg. Though his talents in the genre are largely unrecognized by modern audiences, Veronese was once regarded as Venice�s greatest portraitist. Sixteenth-century biographer Giorgio Vasari, despite his bias toward Florentine artists, voiced his admiration of Veronese�s portraits, which he said were all �beautiful and truly representing the court of the pope and of the emperor and a Venetian Senate, with many noblemen and senators of that Republic portrayed from life.�The man leans on the base of a structure with fluted columns. In a niche between the columns is a marble sculpture of a draped female figure, of which only the lower portion is visible. These clues may refer to the subject's profession, perhaps that of a sculptor or architect. Carved reliefs, barely discernible, adorn the sides of the architectural base. The one at the right perhaps illustrates a classical hero or a warrior in armor. His formal black attire and sword may also imply high military rank or membership in an order of knighthood. In the background at the lower left is the Venetian Basilica of San Marco, placed in an imaginary pastoral setting. The inclusion of the basilica likely alludes to the sitter's association with the church or the Venetian state.
In a composition, alive with naked, twisting bodies, the story of Bacchus's birth unfolds as a wry commentary on the perils of passion. On discovering that the supreme god Jupiter had impregnated the young mortal Semele, Jupiter�s wife, Juno, hatched a plan to end the love affair. Disguised as Semele's nurse, and knowing that Jupiter's lightning and thunder were lethal, Juno persuaded Semele to ask Jupiter to visit her �in all his glory� so that she could be absolutely certain of his identity. Here, Semele gives birth to Bacchus, who falls into the arms of nymphs below while his mother�s body is consumed by flames. From the top of the clouds, Juno looks apprehensively at her husband, who is armed with thunderbolts, her raised hand and furrowed brow signaling uncertainty and perhaps regret over her violent revenge.This scene was originally conceived as part of a series of paintings depicting mythological love stories for Federico Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua (reigned 1530 � 1540). Giulio Romano acted as architect for the ducal palace, the Palazzo del T�, and later became artist to the Mantuan court. While the design of the series was conceived by Giulio himself, it is likely that this work was executed with the help of workshop assistants. The artist�s interest in this subject matter is demonstrated by a drawing of the same subject which is also in the collection of the Getty Museum and illustrates a different composition from that of the painting.
In 1758 the S�vres porcelain manufactory introduced this shape, designed to be mounted onto a small table. The manufactory named the form, described in the S�vres archives as a plateau de Courteille ou de chiffoni�re, after the marquis de Courteille, one of Louis XV's financiers, who represented the king's interest at S�vres from 1751. The S�vres artist Charles-Nicolas Dodin copied the scene from a painting by Fran�ois Boucher onto the plaque. The original painting was set into wood paneling above a door in an important Parisian townhouse, the H�tel de Soubise. It became one of Boucher's most popular scenes in the 1700s, known through many prints that circulated widely throughout Europe.
This folding altarpiece depicts Saint Francis receiving the stigmata on the left and an angel crowning Saints Cecilia and Valerian with floral wreaths on the right. Delphine de Signe, an aristocrat living at the court of Naples in the early 1300s, had sworn a vow of virginity. Despite this, a marriage was arranged between her and Elz�ar de Sabran, also a member of the court. Elz�ar was a deeply religious youth, and Delphine was able to convert him to chastity by recounting the legends of Cecilia and Valerian, early Christian martyrs who took a vow of celibacy for their spiritual beliefs. Although they suffered from family opposition, Delphine and her husband remained devoted to one another and honored their common vow. Since the unusual subject matter of the virgin saints would have held symbolic import and served as a model for Delphine and Elz�ar's own marriage, Delphine may have been the first owner of this diptych. The couple belonged to the lay Third Order of the Franciscans, which explains the depiction of Saint Francis at the left.
Probably intended for a small chapel, this triptych shows the Virgin Mary in the center flanked by Saint Thomas Aquinas and Saint Paul. On the left panel Saint Thomas Aquinas wears the Dominican habit and holds a book of his writings. On the right panel, Saint Paul turns toward the Virgin and holds his symbol of martyrdom, the sword. In the center, the Virgin Mary wears a deep rich blue cloak made from ultramarine or lapis lazuli, a very precious and expensive pigment. A pattern of intricate marks called tooling, punched into the gold, defines the halo around her head. The background of the panels is covered with a thin layer of gold leaf, but the impression is of solid gold, meant to honor the holy figures depicted. As if she is extending into our space, the Virgin Mary reaches over the marble parapet with her right hand. This gesture symbolizes the holy Mother's power and mercy, and her unique position to serve for man as a compassionate link to God. During the 1500s, a reclining Christ Child was added in oil at the bottom, in front of the parapet. The child differed in style from the rest of the tempera painting. After the Museum acquired Bernardo Daddi's painting, conservators realized that the child was a later addition.

The Vision of the Soul of Guy de Thurno is a French translation of a Latin text that discusses Church doctrine on purgatory (in French, the title is La Vision de l'ame de Guy de Thurno). Guy de Thurno was a wealthy citizen of Verona who died and then returned to earth in spirit form to haunt his widowed spouse. She turns to a local priest for help, and a dialogue between the priest and the ghost on the nature of the afterlife results. A single illumination by the renowned Flemish artist Simon Marmion decorates this copy of the text. It shows the priest and the widow, along with four other men, grouped around an empty central space occupied by Guy's ghost. The bystanders look uneasy as the priest actively debates with the unseen spirit. The manuscript was commissioned by Margaret of York, duchess of Burgundy, as a companion piece to her illuminated Visions of the Knight Tondal, also in the Getty collection, which concerns heaven and hell.
The Visions of the Knight Tondal tells the story of a wealthy and errant Irish knight, whose soul goes on a journey through Hell and Paradise with an angel for a guide. As a result of his experience, Tondal is spiritually transformed and vows to lead a more pious life. Before Dante's Divine Comedy, the story of Tondal was one of the most popular in a long tradition of visionary and moralizing literature. Originally written in Latin in the 1100s by Marcus, an Irish monk in Regensburg, the story was later translated into fifteen vernacular languages. The Getty Museum's manuscript of Tondal, written by David Aubert, was written in French (Les Visions du chevalier Tondal). It was commissioned by Margaret of York, duchess of Burgundy and wife of Charles the Bold. She was one of the most famous patrons of manuscript illuminators in a region that outshone even its rival, the kingdom of France, in its prolific patronage. The illumination is attributed to the French artist Simon Marmion. The Museum's manuscript is the only surviving illuminated copy of the text. In its twenty miniatures Marmion represented an extraordinary world of Paradise and Hell in vivid, often terrifying, but always naturalistic, detail.
Surrounded by attendants and seated at a round table before a tiled, outdoor pavilion, the Chinese emperor and empress enjoy a light meal. While the imperial couple are served tea and fruit, a servant reaches up behind them to remove a platter from a buffet of golden dishes and blue-and-white porcelain arranged in the European fashion. Seated on a stool to the left, a female musician with a monkey at her feet plays a stringed instrument resembling a sitar. In the center, a dwarf dances to her music, while to the right a maid drops incense into a golden incense burner. A large carpet covers the platform on which the emperor and empress sit. The edge of the carpet is woven with the inscription of Guy-Louis Vernansal, who was the chief designer of the tapestry series known as The Story of the Emperor of China.
In a tapestry from the series known as The Story of the Emperor of China, a terraced outdoor pavilion is the setting for the return from the hunt. The emperor, still wearing his quiver and holding his bow, leads the empress down the carpeted steps to show her the catch of game: a deer, waterfowl, and other birds. Behind them stands a large, elaborate throne with sphinxes at each armrest and carved, winged dragons on top. Peacock feathers fan from the crest, and jewels line its upper edge.  The double arcade that arches over the throne is a whimsical structure created by the Beauvais artists rather than an authentic Chinese form. This fantastic architecture with its spindly Gothic ornament may have inspired designers of the late 1700s and early 1800s who copied the mixture of Gothic and Far Eastern motifs. This series may be one of the earliest examples of the emerging chinoiserie style, in which Westerners employed exotic Chinese forms combined with European motifs.
Elaborately carved brackets commonly hung in pairs in the grander houses of Paris to support decorative objects such as Chinese or Japanese porcelain vases. Although scholars have not identified the carver of this piece, he would have been an accomplished menuisierwho could have also made tables, chairs, and wooden paneling.
Studies made by two Dutch artists during an exploratory expedition to Brazil from 1637 to 1644 were the inspiration for this tapestry. The newly appointed Dutch governor, Prince Johan Maurits of Nassau, led a group of scientists and artists, including Albert Eckhout and Frans Post, to Brazil, where they studied and painted the unusual plant and animal life of this country. Many of the plants, fish, birds, and other animals woven in this hanging can be traced to life studies made by Eckhout and Post in South America. French artists at the Gobelins manufactory, who designed the cartoon to heighten the tapestry's impression of drama and exoticism, probably introduced other animals, such as the Indian rhinoceros and "striped horse" or zebra.
Designed to hold logs, firedogs or chenetstake their name from the French word for a small dog. Pairs of firedogs were placed inside the fireplace, with their gilt bronze decoration often concealing wrought iron bars that supported the burning wood. These firedogs are unusual as they were not fixed to any metal bars but instead stand before the fire as separate elements of pure decoration. Together with gilt bronze wall lights attached to a mirror frame and a gilt bronze clock on the mantelpiece, the firedogs would have created a glittering display that was the focal point in any elegant salon. These firedogs support four children posed with attributes of the four elements: the sun for Fire, a cornucopia and globe for Earth, an urn for Water, and a chameleon for Air. The last attribute refers to a quote by the ancient philosopher Pliny, who wrote that the chameleon neither ate nor drank but lived on air. Also included are an eagle symbolizing Jupiter and a peacock representing his consort Juno. A refined and educated patron would have appreciated these scholarly references.
As imagined by a French designer of luxury goods who had probably never been to China, the wife of the Chinese emperor Shun Chi embarks on a pleasure boat ride. Three servants attend the empress, one of whom plays a portable keyboard instrument and sings. Other musicians, acrobats, dancing rats, and monkeys entertain her from the landing.  Originally one of a popular, frequently woven set of ten tapestries, this particular subject, "The Empress Sailing," was least common among the series. Only one other surviving example is known.  Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, commissioned this specific tapestry as part of a set for his country residence outside Paris. Nine tapestries from his set are known to survive, each with borders of the same design, including his monogram LA in the four blue ovals of the border. The Getty Museum owns seven tapestries from this set.
Better known for grand, monumental compositions and illusionistic decorations, here Lanfranco painted on a smaller scale, successfully portraying an intimate moment between the Madonna, her son, and her nephew. While the Madonna tenderly caresses her son, the two children extend their arms toward each other, expressing both familial and divine love. The goldfinch held carelessly in the Christ Child's left hand can be interpreted as a prefiguration of the Passion. According to legend, as Christ was led to die on Calvary, a goldfinch flew down and plucked a thorn from his bleeding skin splashing itself with his blood in the process, thus acquiring its characteristic spot of red on its plumage.While working in Rome, Lanfranco received several commissions from Pope Urban VIII (1623�1644), a member of the Barberini family, and great patron of the arts. The painting�s frame�a type that was often used in the Barberini Palace�has led to suggestions that this intimate scene was intended for display in one of the family�s private chapels.
Clasping her hands to her chest, the grieving Virgin Mary looks upon the naked body of the dead Christ. His muscular figure reclines on a cloth stretched out upon a rocky ground. Swathed in heavy drapery, the Virgin, looking aged and worn, sways back as she tilts her head forward. Silhouetted against the dark, empty background, she gives visual expression to the emotional poignancy of the scene. Sculptor Cesare Targone rejected the traditional narrative emphasis of images of the grieving Virgin. He eliminated almost all references to the Crucifixion or Christ's other mourners, focusing solely on the Virgin Mary's sorrow, which then becomes a model for the viewer's response to the dead Christ. This devotional object, made of finely chased embossed gold on black obsidian, may have originally been set into a tabernacle door above an altar.
Blinded and shackled to the columns of the Philistines' temple for public display and ridicule, the Israelite warrior Samson avenged himself by bringing the building down around him and on the heads of his tormentors (Judges 16:21�31). His previously shorn hair, the source of his extraordinary strength, had grown back, returning his power and allowing him to kill more Philistines in death than during his lifetime. Through this immense feat of physical strength, Samson singlehandedly delivered Israel from her enemies. This complex, chaotic composition was intended to be viewed from below, contributing to the sense of the downward movement of the figures tumbling through space. The artist based Samson�s muscular, twisting body on a fragmentary ancient sculpture, the Belvedere Torso, which was frequently referenced in the work of Renaissance artists, including Michelangelo.Though the painting was originally acquired as a work painted by Peter Paul Rubens (Flemish, 1577�1640) during his first years in Italy, this attribution has since been ruled out on stylistic grounds. The elongated faces and tightly controlled brushwork instead might suggest a Genoese creator, perhaps Vincenzo Mal� (Italian, about 1605�about 1660) or Giovanni Battista Merano (Italian, 1632�1698)
Because of his association with Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, the faun usually appears in art with a goatlike face, pointed ears, a tail, and horns. Identified by the Romans as Pan, the god of woods and field, flocks and herds, he was able to charm nymphs with his music. This subject, common in antiquity, regained popularity in the Renaissance and Baroque periods.  Giovanni Battista Foggini, who worked at a time when Florence witnessed an intense interest in the production of bronze reductions of ancient works, based this sculpture on a Hellenistic marble statue in the collection of the Galleria degli Uffizi. Along with only two others of the many known copies of the ancient work, this one includes the tree trunk from the ancient marble, which draws a parallel to the antique but is not needed for support. He may have created the sculpture as a diplomatic gift from the Medici court.
To test Abraham's faith, God ordered him to sacrifice his only child Isaac. Abraham bound Isaac, laid him on the altar, and drew his knife to kill him. At that moment, an angel appeared and held back Abraham's hand, saying, "Now I know you are a God-fearing man, as you have not withheld your only son from me." Giulio Romano captured the scene's drama through the energetic swoop of the angel that hovers over Abraham's head. Abraham peers up astonished, while Isaac cowers on the stone altar. The figures all have squat, stocky proportions, broad faces, and hair and beards composed of solid, horn-like locks and curls. Some scholars speculate that Raphael, Giulio's master, may have begun the drawing, allowing his student to finish it. The drawing was probably made in preparation for a print. The artist used a stylus to outline the scene at first, then fleshed out the composition more fully in red chalk. An existing engraving corresponds in size and detail to this work.
The tradition of portraying male sitters, bust-length, at a three-quarter view, was particularly resonant in Venice and the Venetoregion during the Renaissance. With his bold traits and grave stance, this figure is characteristic of the types featured by Giovanni Bellini and Andrea Mantegna. Short strokes of hatching record the contours of the sitter's face and simultaneously soften it by surrounding it in shadow.
Clad in complementary yellow and blue, a young man and woman coyly eye each other, their hands meeting at the very center of the scene. Lively, overflowing foliage serves as a dramatic and fitting backdrop to this courtship. At the base of the plaque, an inscription in Latin that identifies the pair translates as: Behold the very beautiful Rachel with her sheep, whom Jacob chooses as his wife. Despite the inscription, the scene also includes several details from the biblical account of Rebecca and Eliezer at the well. The jar balanced on the well, the flamingolike camels in the background, and the jewel-laden chest in the foreground are elements of this story. The plaque is based on a mid-seventeenth century image of Rebecca and Eliezer by Jacopo Amigoni, whose paintings and engravings often served as a model for the decoration of plaques and tapestries. It is likely that the painter of the plaque had a print of Amigoni's work in hand but transformed it into the more amorous Jacob and Rachel subject, probably for a specific patron.

A boyish artist gazes longingly at the regal woman whose portrait he is painting. The young artist is Alexander the Great's court painter, Apelles, whom ancient writers considered the greatest artist of their time. According to Pliny's Natural History of 77 A.D., Alexander commissioned Apelles to paint a portrait of his favorite concubine, Campaspe. The story illustrates art's transformative powers: Apelles fell in love with his sitter as he captured her beauty on canvas. Alexander so esteemed his painter that he presented Campaspe to Apelles as a reward for the portrait. The tale of Alexander and Apelles, a favorite of Renaissance and Baroque painters, celebrates the power and nobility of painting. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo painted this episode at least three times. For this, the third rendering, he adopted a classicizing style in which antique architectural elements and relief sculptures evoke a sumptuous palace setting. The background provides a focal area for the gaze of Alexander the Great, who appears handsome and self-confident, yet unaware of the charged glances shared by Apelles and Campaspe.
Gently, Christ places the ornate gold crown upon the Virgin Mary's slightly bowed head. Groups of musical angels watch from either side as she becomes the Queen of Heaven. Gentile da Fabriano used extensive tooling, decorative patterning, gold leaf, and rich pigments to create a sumptuous surface resembling tapestry. The complex patterning, elaborate materials, and long flowing lines of the robes of the Madonna and Christ characterize the International Gothic style. Gentile was commissioned to paint this scene for his native town, Fabriano, when he was at the height of his fame. The gold-encrusted panel functioned as a processional standard held aloft in parades that honored the Virgin Mary. The panel originally depicted The Stigmatization of Saint Francis on the reverse. Sometime prior to 1827, the panel was sawed into two sections; the Saint Francis panel is now in a private collection in Italy.
On an oval panel, a young woman poses in front of a landscape. Smiling slightly, she looks candidly out at the viewer. The sitter, Victoire-Pauline de Riquet de Carama, was an aristocrat, and her status improved when she married Jean-Louis, Vicomte de Vaudreuil in 1781. The artist �lisabeth Louise Vig�e Le Brun emphasized the Vicomtesse's status and refinement by carefully depicting her fashionable straw hat, silk dress, and gauze scarf, collar, and cuffs. Displaying her education, the Vicomtesse places her right thumb in her book to mark her place, as if she has been interrupted while reading. Vig�e Le Brun adopted this obvious gesture often used in men's portraits to illustrate women's importance in French Enlightenment circles.
The angel Gabriel interrupts Mary at her devotions and announces, "You shall conceive and bear a son, and you shall give him the name Jesus." (Luke 1:31) In an attitude of humility, Mary sits on the plain tiled floor, eyes downcast, and raises her hands in surprise. Gabriel, dressed in white with multi-colored wings, kneels and points towards the circular window above, indicating the presence of God. With his other hand he draws back the curtain of the canopy. Dieric Bouts painted the scene in a lucid and spatially convincing setting. The room at the left is simply described: a barrel ceiling, a marble column with two steps leading up to the room, and a stained glass window. A mood of solemnity, suitable for prayer, pervades the scene. In this somber setting Bouts's use of bright red for the drapery seems unusual. It may signify the Passion, forecasting the death of Christ, or it may be purely decorative since Bouts used this color in other compositions. The Annunciation belongs to a set of five paintings that originally constituted a polyptych representing scenes from the life of Jesus Christ. It was probably the upper left panel of an altarpiece that included paintings of the Adoration of the Magi, Entombment (upper right), Resurrection (lower right), and perhaps the Crucifixion in the center.
This three-part altarpiece depicts the visionary experiences of the layman Chiarito del Voglia, who commissioned it in the 1340s. The central panel--executed in gilded gesso relief and showing the apostles receiving communion through narrow tubes emanating from Christ's navel--is most unusual in subject matter and medium. The left wing displays scenes from Christ's Passion, the events leading up to his Crucifixion. In an unusual addition, three scenes below the main panel feature the bearded donor Chiarito participating in the Mass. In the central scene, he participates in the communion of the Apostles shown above by means of a tube that extends down to his mouth. On the right wing in the bottom panel, Chiarito, seen standing alone, listens to a monk preaching to an audience. His powerful vision is made manifest in the scene above. He imagines the blood of Christ flowing down from the Trinity, shown in the top panel, to bathe the crowd below. Diagonal lines on the pulpit direct the viewer's eyes to the flowing blood.
As a boy, Th�odore G�ricault loved drawing horses and would sit in the stables watching and sketching. In 1817, he traveled to Rome where he witnessed the annual Carnival horse race and subsequently made numerous studies of this spectacle. This study marks the moment just before the race begins, when the terrified riderless horses begin their run down the Corso in Rome.
Inspired by a series of apostles that Rubens painted in 1610 for the Duke of Lerma, Spain's chief minister, Anthony van Dyck set about making his own similar series, including this painting of the Apostle Simon. Simon is shown bust-length, his head turned so that his profile is "lost" or partially obscured by shadow. His left hand rests on a saw, the instrument of his martyrdom. Light falls from the top left, creating highlights and deep shadows across his head, face, hand, and clothing. Draperies are broadly painted and richly colored, while the apostle's hair, eyebrows, and beard are finely painted to convey their wavy, silky texture.
Near death after being tied to a tree and shot through with arrows, Saint Sebastian barely notices the angel helping to remove them. Anthony van Dyck painted the subject of Saint Sebastian many times, choosing various moments in the saint's story but never focusing on the one thing that most other artists emphasized: the saint's flesh punctured with arrows. Van Dyck's goal was to explore the subject's emotional possibilities, rather than the physical wounds. In this scene, the naked and defenseless Saint Sebastian is so consumed by suffering that he is practically unaware of the angel's assistance. Using a monochromatic grisaille technique and thin paint, Van Dyck rapidly sketched in his composition, exploring the effect of light and shadow on Christ's torso and the angel's body. He painted this oil sketch in preparation for a painting that was probably never completed or is now lost. It combines the freshness, immediacy, and fluency of a drawing with the monumentality of a large painting. These qualities characterize the Flemish oil sketch, which Peter Paul Rubens first developed as an alternative to drawing and which Van Dyck, his most gifted pupil, soon adopted.
At the apex of this theatrically arranged study, Augustus Caesar sits in front of the Temple of Janus and touches the shoulder of a man personifying Rome. Surrounding him are scholars and statesmen while foreign tribes gather below. The Nativity scene in the foreground illustrates the coincidental moment of world peace under Augustus when Christ was born. In 1852, Jean-L�on G�r�me received a state commission to paint a large mural of an allegorical subject of his choosing. In selecting this subject, G�r�me perhaps sought to flatter Emperor Napoleon III, whose government commissioned the painting and who was identified as a "new Augustus." In preparation for his large mural, G�r�me traveled all over to find the appropriate ethnic types to portray the different peoples of the ancient world. When The Age of Augustus, The Birth of Christ was shown in 1855 at the Universal Exposition, his skill in depicting various nationalities led some to remark that G�r�me gave a lesson whenever he painted a picture.
Saturn, one of the Titans who once ruled earth in Roman mythology, devours the infant child he holds in his arm. According to a prophecy, Saturn would be overthrown by one of his sons. In response, he ate his sons as soon as they were born. But the mother of his children, Rhea, hid one child, Zeus. Later, Zeus gave his father a potion, forcing him to regurgitate his siblings; he then vanquished his father and ruled over earth, fulfilling the prophecy. Saturn's cannibalism is graphically shown here: in his left hand he holds a bone from one of his already eaten children while he partially ingests the child in his arm. Simon Hurtrelle represented Saturn as a powerful, yet elderly figure with wings. The wings suggest the speed of time and derive from the association of Saturn, also known as Cronos, with the Greek god of time, Chronus. Similarly, Saturn's loss of hair indicates the passing of time. The composition of the bronze was inspired by an antique Roman marble sculpture that Hurtrelle saw in Rome.
Mercury, god of science, commerce, and travel in Greek and Roman mythology, was messenger to the god Jupiter. Identified by his winged helmet, he originally held a caduceus, which is now broken. His raised left foot rests on the head of the monster Argus, whom Mercury killed to free one of Jupiter's lovers. The young god's lithe, elongated body and the pronounced shift of his body weight from one leg to the other are characteristic features of the Mannerist style. The figure's downward glance suggests that the original work was meant to be executed on a larger scale and to be seen from below. Alessandro Vittoria probably designed this freestanding figure and a bronze Minerva as pendants, both of which he signed. The drapery support behind the figure suggests that the bronze is a copy of a work originally carved in marble and then reproduced in metal. In marble statues a support bears the weight of the piece, but it has no function in bronze statues. The bronze bears little evidence of work after the casting. All the details were worked out in the wax core, attesting to the high quality of the casting technique.
A woman dressed as a priestess leads a young girl, covering herself with a swath of cloth, toward a statue of Priapus, the ancient god of fertility. With distinctive goatlike ears, Priapus appears in the form of a term, a statue marking a territorial boundary. The smoking incense and the sacrificial tripod indicate that the young girl is making an offering of her charms. Cupid winds a floral garland around the statue of Priapus, camouflaging his characteristic erect phallus. Sculptor Claude Michel, called Clodion, frequently drew from ancient mythology for his terracottas, but his borrowings rarely focused on grand events. For Clodion, ancient culture provided a classical figure style, a repertory of characters and settings, and perhaps most importantly, a nostalgic mood. As was typical of the Rococo style, his works tended to be playful and erotic. Although Clodion finished the piece in the round, he designed it to be seen from the front, placed on a piece of furniture or on a mantelpiece. Known for his masterful handling of wet clay, the artist focused on texture, differentiating clingy or billowing drapery from satin-textured skin.
Vestal Virgins, consecrated to Vesta, Roman goddess of the hearth, served in temples as guardians of an eternal, sacred flame and were expected to emulate the goddess's purity and chastity. In his representation of one of these women, sculptor Antonio Canova suggested her innocence through the austerity and sparseness of the Neoclassical style, drawing on the contemporary idea that classical forms carry with them the expression of a strict morality. The bust is made of simple geometric shapes: a square for the bust and oval for the face. The tightly wound headcovering pulls in her hair and, with the cloak, draws attention to the purity of the shapes. Her firm shoulders and uninhibited, unmoving stare further suggest her resolve, innocence, and moral authority. Despite her physical beauty and the softness of the folds of the cloak, the statue does not invite touching. It is a cool, intellectual work of simple forms and restrained emotion. With the discovery of the so-called House of the Vestals in Pompeii, Vestal Virgins became a popular subject in the 1700s and 1800s. This figure wears a historically accurate cloak, which suggests that Canova researched the subject.
Known in his paintings for exploring the effects of light on surfaces, Titian here showed that he could achieve similar results with line. His meticulous execution and concern for detail suggest the light, space, and variety of physical forms in the landscape. He suggested textures through varying styles of line, from the loose sketchiness of the puffy trees at the left to the more detailed, yet fluidly rendered, drapery on the female figure at the right. Carefully and economically placed hatchings capture the goat's shimmering fur. Titian even created air with line, as in the atmosphere that envelops the distant city. The subject is enigmatic, though it may relate to the erotic mythologies that Titian was painting for King Philip II of Spain at about the same time. The underlying theme may be Idleness or Indolence, represented by the two shepherds lounging in the shade with their flock of sheep. Indolence may lead to Lust, personified by the female nude whose face is covered and accompanied by her attributes, the goat and the boar.
The composition of this two-foot tall bronze sculpture--with its contrapposto pose and ancient Greek cloak--is based on what artists and collectors considered one of the most beautiful surviving statues from antiquity, the ancient Roman marble known as Belvedere Antinous, now in the Vatican Museums. While the original was first thought to represent Roman Emperor Hadrian's handsome Greek lover Antinous, scholars now believe the work is a representation of the Olympian god Hermes. Considered a model of ideal human proportions, the statue inspired many artistic interpretations.  From the Renaissance on, the European elite sought reduced-size bronze reproductions made after famous ancient models to display in their collections. It is believed French aristocrat and collector Louis Hesselin commissioned this statue during a trip to Italy in the 1630s. Upon his death, this bronze, along with more than thirty others he owned, was acquired by the Sun King, Louis XIV.  The N.4 engraved on the back of the right ankle is the statue's inventory number from the bronze collection of the French Crown, indicating the statue's royal provenance.
Crisply painted and teeming with detail, Boilly's picture transports us to Napoleonic Paris, where we stand on a shady boulevard outside the Jardin Turc (Turkish Garden Caf�), a popular establishment that offered its middle-class clientele pleasures formerly reserved for the aristocracy. Young and old, fashionable and not, Parisians gather here for an afternoon's leisure. Two young street performers entertain the crowd: one shows an elegant couple his tame marmot, while the other puts on a puppet show for children hardly younger than himself. A resident of the Marais neighborhood, in which the scene takes place, Boilly included a self-portrait, in spectacles and a top hat, at the painting's rightmost edge.
Below a rocky acropolis, two women in classical attire converse with each other. The dress and gesture of the standing woman are echoed in the life-size marble sculpture at the right edge of the painting. Another pair of figures is less immediately visible. On a shadowed pathway, they wind their way up the rough hillside toward the citadel. In the distance, sailboats move in and out of shafts of rain as they traverse a thin sliver of turquoise sea. Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes exhibited this landscape at the Salon of 1789. The painting's Salon title, a general one, suggests that its subject is simply an imagined classical past. This is an idyllic and idealized antiquity where human activity and architecture are in harmony with one another and with the natural world.
Before his arrest, Christ prays outside Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives, �Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me� (Luke 22:42 [Douay-Rheims]), referring to his impending suffering and death. In the foreground are three of the disciples � the beardless young John, James with his hands joined in prayer, and Peter sleeping while holding a sword. In the background Judas, clutching a moneybag, leads soldiers in through a gate. The composition is based on images found in prints depicting sequential scenes from the Passion of Christ, and this panel was likely one in a series of such glass roundels.
After having been warned about the wrath of Herod, the Holy Family flees Bethlehem to seek safety in Egypt (Matthew 2:13-15). In association with this episode, depictions of Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus at rest in the countryside became a popular image of family intimacy. The sensitive rendering of the figures in this roundel was likely inspired by the works of contemporary Netherlandish painters.
A popular medieval legend about Saint Margaret involves her miraculous escape after being swallowed alive by Satan disguised as a dragon. Here Margaret is shown holding the chains of a subdued dragon while blessing a donor�s coat of arms. The delicately painted features of the saint, carefully rendered costume, and charming depiction of bluebells at the lower right give a sense of realism and substance to the composition.
This aged and emaciated figure is the blind general Belisarius. Heavy eyelids almost completely cover his eyes, which register nothing of the outside world. Deeply set eye sockets, encircled by wrinkles, also draw attention to Belisarius's blindness. His veined and wrinkled forehead, tilted head, and open mouth, emphasize his vulnerable state. In the mid-1700s, a novel by Jean-Fran�ois Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius--a popular general of the Roman Empire whose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for painters and sculptors--including Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Fran�ois G�rard (whose painting Belisarius is also in the Museum's collection). Jean-Baptiste Stouf exhibited this marble sculpture at the Salon of 1791; he had previously shown a terracotta model of the bust of Belisarius in 1785. Like many eighteenth-century artists who depicted Belisarius, Stouf emphasized the subject's pathos, highlighting the injustice of the general's plight. The intimate and sympathetic portrait also demonstrates Stouf's mastery of marble carving. The luxuriantly sculpted beard and cascading curls of hair, the crumpled, crinkled skin, and the broad, high brow are all captured with a subtlety that belies the challenge of carving stone. The formal characteristics of Belisarius echo classical and Baroque sculpture but also anticipate the Romantic sensibility of the 1800s.
Pietro Longhi depicts the act of painting as an intimate scene of contemporary life. Longhi invites the viewer into a painter's studio, where the artist, surrounded by an array of his tools and props, creates a faithful likeness of a typical Venetian lady sitting for her portrait. Her costumed companion has removed his mask, which allowed him to pass incognito in public during the free-spirited months of Carnival.
This marble bust, cut just under the shoulders, represent a little boy of a very young age, probably around three years-old. Wearing a very fine tunic, he slightly turns his head to his left, his semi-opened eyes marked by a pensive gaze and his closed lips barely outlining the hint of a smile. The marble is skillfully carved as to evoke the smooth skin of the cheeks, the chubby flesh of the neck, and the silky hair whose elegantly intertwined locks are masterfully rendered in very low relief.Such command of contours, subtle gradations of surface textures and sensitivity of expression are characteristic of the style of sculptor Desiderio da Settignano, who brought an unsurpassed level of observation to the portrayal of children.The marble bust of a young boy was a Renaissance sculptural genre, most likely invented by Desiderio da Settignano, that originated in mid-quattrocento Florence and whose production ended around 1510, with the fall of the republic. Such busts belong to a 15th-century context in which childhood was first recognized as a distinct stage of life and their purpose may have been to lay the foundation of nobility, in a civic consciousness of patrons who saw children as the future leadership of the republic. They reflect awareness of ancient Roman portrait-busts of children but are infused with a liveliness alien to their Roman forerunners.This Bust of a Young Boy portrays a child with full cheeks, a small straight nose and a prominent chin, which testify to the artist's interest in preserving the features of an actual boy. But the identity of the sitter is impossible to determine because no document would inform on these very private commissions.
For four years, Saint Jerome retreated to the desert, where he purified his soul through physical suffering. The bearded saint sits in front of a barren and rocky background, his emaciated body a testament to his ascetic life. He directs his gaze to a crucifix that he holds in his left hand. During his time of religious contemplation, Saint Jerome was tormented by vivid hallucinations; his right hand clasps a rock with which he would beat his breast until the visions passed. A nook in the vaulted structure behind him holds his attributes: a cardinal's hat and a book referring to his translation of the Bible into Latin. A small lion inside the shelter recalls the fable in which Jerome pulls a thorn from a lion's paw, forever securing the animal's devotion. Ercole de'Roberti was artist to the court of Ferrara in northern Italy. The elongated forms, taut, linear rhythms, subtle colors, and meticulous, gold-flecked details of this painting convey the sophistication prized by Ercole's aristocratic patrons. This small devotional painting demands a focused concentration from the viewer that echoes Jerome's efforts to come closer to God.
From the safety of the cave where they have taken refuge, Lot�s daughters appear absorbed by an event taking place beyond the painting�s borders�God�s annihilation of the city of Sodom, burning in the distance. Believing that they alone survive to perpetuate the human race, the daughters have plied their father with alcohol, to aid their incestuous seduction of him. Each will later bear Lot a son: Moab and Ammon, the founders of tribes often pitted against Israel. Depictions of Lot and his Daughters were popular in seventeenth-century Europe because they provided a righteous context in which to illustrate a social taboo. The subject is often interpreted as a mere pretext for artists to engage with an erotic theme, but the absence of nudity or palpable sensuality in this scene suggests that Gentileschi�s intentions were otherwise.Gentileschi was born in Pisa, but settled in Rome in about 1576. From around 1600, he began to absorb the powerful naturalism of Caravaggio, subsequently becoming one of his closest and most successful followers. However, Gentileschi never gave himself over fully to the uncompromising Caravaggesque style, and maintained traits more characteristic of his native Tuscany; a poetic, refined aesthetic that incorporated a rich blend of highly pitched cool and warm colors.A pendant piece to this work, Dana� and the Shower of Gold is also in the Getty�s collection. Both paintings were commissioned by the nobleman Giovanni Antonio Sauli in 1621 for his Palazzo in Genoa, along with a third, The Penitent Magdalene, which is today in a private collection.
Spring in the Alps depicts a panoramic alpine landscape near the village of Soglio�visible on the right with its recognizable church tower-in Val Bregaglia in southwestern Switzerland. The view sweeps across the expansive plateau and valley to the majestic, snow-capped Sciora Massif and Bondasca Glacier. In the middle of the composition a robust farm girl, dressed in the blue and red peasant costume characteristic of the Grisons (Graub�nden) Canton, leads two large draught horses past a watering trough. They have left the freshly plowed field, visible in the left middle ground, where a sower scatters seeds; a vigilant black and white dog stands guard at the right. The joyful mood of the picture is expressed in the bright, shimmering sunlight and the glorious, expansive vista. The crisp colors of the season define the landscape against the brilliant ultramarine sky and the ribbons of thin clouds overhead. The painting is a vivid hymn to the reawakening of nature in spring after a long, hard winter, a pantheistic work in which the landscape, the rural workers, and the animals evoke the cycle of nature. Segantini counted Spring in the Alps among his greatest paintings, and it has become one of the most celebrated pictures of the Italian Ottocento, much exhibited and published.
In a plumed helmet, the Persian warrior-maiden Clorinda arrives on her white horse to save the lovers Sofronia and Olindo, who are about to be burned at the stake. The subject comes from one of the most popular books of its time, Torquato Tasso's epic about the First Crusade. When Aladine, the king of Jerusalem, threatened to execute the whole Christian community for the theft of a sacred image, Sofronia took the responsibility on herself to save the others. Her beloved Olindo then claimed to be the thief to save her, but Aladine condemned them both. Impressed by the young couple's courage, Clorinda saved them from the fire by offering to fight for the king in the coming battle with the Crusaders.  All eyes are riveted on Clorinda, whose leaning posture and pointing gesture lead diagonally up to the figures of Sofronia and Olindo. Figures press close to the picture plane against a turbulent black, yellow, and orange streaked sky. Mattia Preti used strong chiaroscuro to contrast the partially illuminated, startled faces of the crowd with the determination of Clorinda's shadowed profile. Sofronia and Olindo are brightly lit, perhaps indicating the nearness of the fire.
Holding the jawbone as his attribute, Samson looks upward, perhaps to God. The great strongman slew a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass (Judges 15:19). Overcome by thirst, he then drank from the rock at Lechi, a name that also means "jawbone" in Hebrew. Due to a mistaken translation in the Dutch Bible, some artists depicted Samson with a jawbone, rather than the rock, issuing water.  Salomon de Bray used a clear light, plain background, and a half-length composition, showing his awareness of the artistic conventions of the Utrecht Caravaggisti.  Samson with the Jawbone shares the same size, medium, and composition with David with His Sword; they were probably intended as pendants or companions in a series of Old Testament heroes.
Framed by an arched doorway, two soldiers sit smoking, drinking, and chatting with a young woman who sits casually on tiled steps. Behind the woman, a warm light enters to permeate the setting and the objects and figures within. To the right, another woman descends a dark staircase and prepares to enter the room. In the foreground a jumble of objects--rifles, armor, a drum, a pipe, an overturned pail, and yellow drapery--form a more complicated still life grouping. On the back wall, a wooden rack holds pewter plates, crockery, and spoons. This genre scene, an unidealized view of everyday life, illustrates Jacob Duck's shrewd observation of costumes, setting, and objects, as well as his ability to render the surfaces of metal, stone, cloth, and wood.
Classically proportioned sea gods and goddesses, partially clad in intensely colored drapery, form a dramatic procession against a light blue sky. This painting illustrates an episode in Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (Strife of Love in a Dream of Polyphilus), an extravagant Renaissance tale of a dream-journey through antiquity. To the left, the lovers Polyphilus and Polia are ferried to Cythera, the island of love. The sea goddess Amphitrite, reclining in a shell at the lower right, and Neptune, seated high on a shell and holding his triton, watch the boat depart from amid a crowd of figures.  Although it was first published in 1499, Colonna's book enjoyed immense popularity in seventeenth-century France. Marine Gods Paying Homage to Love is one of Eustache Le Sueur's eight canvases illustrating the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili; it was painted as a model for a Gobelins tapestry that was never executed.
The Archbishop of Cambrai, Charles de Saint-Albin, was the illegitimate son of Philippe, duc d'Orl�ans, and a dancer at the opera. Although his father never recognized him officially, he smoothed his son's swift advance in the Church hierarchy and aided his appointment to the archbishopric of Cambrai. In the year of his appointment, the archbishop commissioned this portrait from Hyacinthe Rigaud, the most accomplished and flattering portraitist at the court of Louis XIV. Shown in his robes of office, Saint-Albin balances a book on his knee and presses his left hand to his chest, a gesture suggesting his spirituality. Rigaud masterfully displayed the different textures of his shimmering satin robe and the exquisitely patterned lace of the garment worn underneath. A soft ermine cape is painted so realistically that the viewer can see the indentations left by Saint-Albin's fingers as they press against the fur.
In the foreground of this minutely detailed painting, a maid attempts to revive an elegant young woman who has fainted. In the background, a doctor examines a vial of the woman's urine. The dandyish doctor, whose ostentatious clothing suggests that he is a quack, was a stock figure in contemporary theater, and his inclusion here adds a touch of buffoonery. An erotic painting hangs above the fireplace, hinting that the woman suffers from lovesickness. A crying girl seen in the right background holds a burning ribbon, which was understood at the time as a symbol of pregnancy.
Despite his small size, this figure of Neptune, god of the sea, has a powerful and imposing presence. He may have originally been the centerpiece for a fountain. In his right hand he once held a trident, now missing, while in his left he holds a conch shell. The artist, probably Benedikt Wurzelbauer, suggests the nude figure's great strength through the carefully articulated muscles on his chest and the veins on his arms. The figure leans his weight on his back leg, arching his back slightly as if fighting the wind that blows his hair and beard. His upraised arms, the twist of his right wrist, and the position of his feet recall dance poses. The high gloss on the bronze and the slight twist in the torso bring out a shimmering play of light on the metallic surface. In contrast to Italian practice, German foundries of this period frequently used wood rather than terracotta or wax models. The rigid treatment of this figure's details, together with its stiff pose and the planar handling of its surfaces, suggests that it was cast from a carved wood model.
Tiziano Aspetti, one of the most prominent sculptors in late sixteenth-century Venice, probably originally designed this small bronze statue of a nude male either as an andiron ornament or as one of a group of figures to be placed along a balustrade or in a collector's studio, known as a studiolo. In the 1400s, the image of the nude male and the use of bronze were revived as Italian artists looked back to the culture of ancient Greece and Rome for inspiration. Though its subject is ancient, this work was conceived in a thoroughly innovative style of expressionistic and dramatic movement. In typical Mannerist style, the figure twists elegantly, revealing a play of shimmering effects on the surface as the light reflects off pronounced muscles. The figure's animated face, as if in mid-speech, was designed to engage the viewer, much as his pose encouraged the viewer to walk around the sculpture.
Since antiquity, rulers have minted coins and medals to celebrate their power and dominion. On this gold medal from about 1600, the Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II wears a laurel wreath, a sign of victory and peace, and the chain and pendant of the Order of the Golden Fleece. The Latin inscription on the front, RUDOLPHUS II ROM IMP AUG REX HUNG BOE, declares Rudolf the Supreme Emperor of the Romans, King of Hungary and Bohemia. On the reverse, a ram, zodiac sign of the constellation Capricorn, refers to Augustus Caesar, who was conceived under this sign, suggesting an analogy between Rudolf and Caesar. The Latin inscription, ASTRUM FULGET CAES (The Emperor's Star Shines Brightly), along with the symbols of the twinkling star, the earth, and the Habsburg eagle, suggest Rudolf's supremacy and the prosperous future of the Habsburg dynasty. The emperor's elegant three-quarter pose and the subtle differentiation of textures on the medal demonstrate the high quality of the casting. The hair is suggested by blunt troughs and lines, the emperor's ruffle has the illusion of depth, and the skin is polished smooth, while the drapery's thick folds effectively suggest heavy fabric.
By the 1500s, Germanic glassmakers developed large, clear glass forms, partly to accommodate the demand for enamel decoration. Vessel types such as this goblet provided broad surface areas for painted figural and heraldic scenes. Dated 1576, this goblet is one of the earliest known dated hunting glasses. Hunt glasses, a standard German subject type, only became common in the 1580s. In the 1500s and 1600s, Germanic glass painters and engravers used biblical, mythological, allegorical, erotic, and genre themes to decorate vessels, sometimes repeating certain motifs over and over for generations.
The reading female represents an allegory of Study, while her male companion who writes on a tablet is Philosophy. These purely decorative objects copy the form of ancient oil lamps, but they were not actually functional. In 1780 the sculptor Louis-Simon Boizot sold models for these figures to the S�vres porcelain manufactory, which produced them in unglazed white porcelain until 1786. The bronze chaser Pierre-Philippe Thomire mounted many pieces of the porcelain sold by the factory and therefore could have obtained Boizot's models for these bronze pieces through this close connection.
The delicately painted head of a youth on a single piece of uncolored glass is an element from a larger unknown panel. It was later set within old fragments of red and blue glass to form the present medallion. The current arrangement focuses attention on the sensitively rendered features of the head as a beautiful example of fourteenth-century glass painting.
The subject of the archangel Michael vanquishing the Devil comes from the book of Revelation and was popular during the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance. The composition of this roundel is after a 1510 woodcut by the artist Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen (ca. 1475-1533) of Amsterdam. Here, the stained glass painter has faithfully copied the dramatic representation of the two figures from the print, and has added details of an expansive landscape with buildings of a northern European character. This was in the tradition of the so-called �Weltlandschaft� (World-landscape) symbolizing the global implications of Saint Michael�s deed. This panel is notable for the delicacy of the painting, with fine stippling and picked-out highlights, and for the sophisticated use of silver stain, which ranges from subtle shades of lemon-yellow to more strident tones of fiery-orange.
Housing the Stranger is one of the Seven Works of Mercy taught by the Christian church. This panel is based on one print from a set illustrating the subject after designs by Maerten van Heemskerck (1498-1574) produced by Dirck Volkertsz Coornhert (1522-1590) in 1552. Travelers at the left, indicated by their hats and staffs, are greeted by a man in a doorway, behind whom sits another man on a bed.  Additional figures and a bed are depicted at the upper left. The fragments in the lower right are from another panel representing a different scene from the same series, Giving Drink to the Thirsty, hence the depiction of a large ewer and bottle. The stained glass artist has carefully reproduced the details of the print, and used subtle shades of vitreous paint to render a richly textured and finely detailed grisaille image.
In this self-portrait a young Edgar Degas turns his head to look out at the spectator. He wears casual clothes, including an open collar and broad brimmed hat. The informal, extreme close-up view of Degas's face and his impassive, almost sullen expression echo the unpretentiousness of his clothing. The small-scale, informal presentation and lightness of touch emphasize the intimacy of this image and the still-tentative character of the young artist. Around 1857, when he was twenty-three or twenty-four, Degas traveled to Italy, where he spent much of his time making copies after Renaissance masters. The period was one of self-education and he drew prolifically, writing in one of his notebooks, "I must thoroughly realize I know nothing at all; it is the only way to get ahead." Finding in himself a willing sitter, he made fifteen or more self-portraits in various media during his time in Italy.
Emerging from deep shadows behind a table, a solemn individual stands displaying a well-worn book with various geometric figures, pseudo-Greek characters, and an imaginary script. Jusepe de Ribera paid considerable attention to the man's facial details, from the unkempt beard to the distinctive creases of his high forehead and the irregular folds of the lids above his dark, penetrating eyes. He depicted the wise man with tattered clothes and blackened, grimy fingers to emphasize the subject's devotion to intellectual, rather than material, pursuits. The presence of mathematical diagrams in the illegible book reveal the figure's identity as Euclid, a prominent mathematician from antiquity, best known for his treatise on geometry, the Elements. Portraits of wise men were very popular in the 1600s, when there was a revived interest in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy. Rather than portraying the subject as a refined and noble figure, Ribera depicted him as an individual tried by a life of hardship, imbued with the force of a living personality.
The panel depicts a rarely represented episode from one of the apocryphal chapters of the biblical Book of Daniel (14:32-35). While taking food to workers in a field, the prophet Habakkuk is interrupted by an angel who instructs him to deliver the meal instead to Daniel trapped in the lions� den in Babylon. Here the encounter between Habakkuk and the angel is depicted in the foreground, the prophet holds a large bowl with high handles, and reapers are shown in the middle ground. The two figures are seen again at the top of the composition with the angel holding Habbakuk by the hair while carrying him to the city of Babylon, seen in the background. This panel was probably one of a series by Wouter Crabeth illustrating episodes from the Book of Daniel. Wouter and his elder brother Dirck were the most famous Netherlandish glass painters of the sixteenth century, admired especially for their windows produced for the Sint Janskerk at Gouda.
A high horizon line provides a bird's-eye view into a vast, lush valley filled with moist air, and gradations of tone and atmospheric perspective define distance. The painting smoothly draws the viewer into the landscape, following an S-shaped journey beginning with the mythological figures at the lower right, continuing on the road at left, and winding back into the distant harbor below. The narrative story in the lower right corner takes place without much fanfare: the mythological figures simply have equal status as compositional elements with the trees and cliffs. Mercury, the standing figure, lulls the seated Argus to sleep with his flute, thus leaving the beautiful white cow--a transformation of the nymph Io--unguarded. This artist was not chiefly interested in the myth, but he or she needed an excuse for painting a landscape. Artists of the 1500s usually presented their landscapes as settings for myths or Biblical stories. Despite the burgeoning market for pictures featuring landscapes, landscape was not yet considered an independent subject.
This painting is part of a series of works executed by Gentileschi in 1622 for Giovanni Antonio Sauli�s Genoese Palazzo which includes the Getty�s Lot and His Daughters and a painting now in a private collection, The Penitent Magdalene. The subject is based on a passage in Ovid�s Metamorphoses, in which King Acrisius of Argos imprisoned his beautiful daughter in order to avoid the Oracle�s prophesy that she would give birth to a son who would kill him. In the story, Jupiter takes the form of a shower of gold and impregnates Dana�, who then gives birth to Perseus. This subject was often exploited by artists as an opportunity to depict an erotic female nude. Here, Cupid pulls back the luxuriant dark green curtain to allow the god to enter the bedchamber, and the viewer too is invited to witness the moment of seduction. A transparent veil is draped across Dana�, though rather than covering her modesty, the fabric creates a tantalizing and sensual focal point on her body. The picture is a meticulous study of light, surface effects and color; the artist skillfully renders the sheen of the fabrics, ranging from the gold bedcover to the cool white linen sheet and deep crimson mattress.
Dosso Dossi depicts Saint George in the aftermath of his legendary battle with the dragon, wielding the creature's bloodied head and the lance broken during the fight. The victorious saint emerges from the darkness as a rainbow breaks through the storm clouds above. Dossi poignantly expressed his subject's recent emotional turmoil in the saint's penetrating expression. He appears weary yet resolute in his triumph, perhaps relieved that his strenuous battle has come to an end. A third-century Christian warrior, Saint George was the patron saint of Ferrara, the artist�s native city. The early provenance of this painting is unknown, but the subject may indicate that it was commissioned by a local Ferrarese collector. The wooden staff grasped in the saint�s left hand is inscribed with symbols of Saint George's Christian faith�crosses rendered in vivid strokes of red paint as though the blood of his vanquished foe drips down its shaft. The color of the crosses echoes the blood pooling in the beast's mouth.
Bronzino depicts Saint John the Baptist's muscular figure in a restricted space, his torso twisted to accommodate the panel�s vertical format which creates a series of strong diagonal accents, zigzagging the length of the painting. This artificial, serpentine pose marks Bronzino�s move away from naturalism toward a more abstract elongation of forms and more stylized figures, a shift which occurred in the 1540s. The long, vertical format of this work corresponds to its original function as part of a triptych altarpiece in the private chapel of Eleonora di Toledo in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Bronzino decorated the chapel between 1540 and 1565, as a celebration of the Medici dynasty. The larger, central panel of the original altarpiece (now in the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts et d�Arch�ologie, Besan�on, France) depicted the Lamentation, which was flanked by the present painting on the left, and Saint Cosmas on the right (a fragment of which is today in a private collection). The saints were chosen by Bronzino for their relevance to the Medici�Saint John was the patron saint of Florence, while Saint Cosmas was the name saint of Eleonora's husband, Cosimo de' Medici.
The centaur Nessus offered to carry Dejanira, the wife of Hercules, across the river Evenus and then abducted her. Having already crossed the river, Hercules hid in the rocky crags beyond, readying a poisoned arrow to let loose on Nessus. Gustave Moreau contrasted the centaur's dark skin and muscular strength with Dejanira's pale flesh and graceful, lithe figure. The two figures resemble dancers performing a ballet rather than opponents struggling for sexual conquest. With its jagged mountains, the hazy, mysterious landscape provides an eerie background. Moreau was not interested in presenting detailed information about the setting or its elements; he chose instead to disintegrate forms, allowing them to give way to areas of color that suggest shapes. The artist intended for Dejanira to belong to a set of pictures representing the changing seasons; the painting's autumnal palette of reds, oranges, browns, dark greens, and creamy whites conveys its other title, Autumn. Moreau described what he had in mind to the painting's first owner: I have tried to render the harmony that may exist between the world of nature at a certain time of year and certain phases of human life. The centaur seeks to embrace this white and graceful form, which is about to escape him. It is a last gleam, a last smile of nature and life. Winter threatens. Night is coming on. It is autumn.
The subject of the penitent Mary Magdalene lifting her teary eyes to heaven gained great popularity in sixteenth-century Italy amongst aristocrats, religious figures and the wealthy middle class alike. Titian and his workshop created many copies and variations of this composition, at least seven of which are known today. This work is likely to have been executed with some workshop assistance. In this variation, the artist omits the skull which appears in other compositions, and instead depicts the Magdalene's Bible resting on a cloth-covered support. Such minor alterations to compositions was often made at the request a patron, who wanted a work similar to one which already existed, but unique in some way. The sacrament of Penance had important significance in Counter-Reformation spirituality, and artists frequently portrayed penitent saints as exemplars of religious fervor. Such works were meant to inspire a greater devotion, at a time when Catholicism was being challenged by Protestant reform. On the other hand, the popularity of The Magdalene as a subject is also associated with her implied sexuality. Her passive gaze and partially naked body appealed to male viewers, for whom such paintings offered a moralizing context through which to engage with the sensuality of the female form. The Magdalene�s partly exposed breasts and long, flowing hair, would have held erotic connotations for the sixteenth-century viewer. Upon encountering one of Titian�s conceptions of the Penitent Magdalene, biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511�1574) denied such sexual undertones, and declared that the picture �profoundly stirs the emotions of all who look at it; and, moreover, although the figure Mary Magdalene is extremely lovely it moves one to thoughts of pity rather than desire.� X-rays of the painting reveal that the artist made numerous changes to the composition, known as pentimenti, suggesting that the composition was developed and altered during its execution.
This side wing and its companion were once part of an altarpiece commissioned in 1408 by the confraternity of the Virgin and Saint Stephen for the church of Santo Stefano in Pane, on the outskirts of Florence. The central panel, now in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, shows the Coronation of the Virgin. In the Getty Museum's panel, Saint Lawrence, with his name inscribed beneath, faces the viewer. He is also identified by his attribute, partially seen behind him, the gridiron on which he was martyred. Saint Stephen, identified by an inscription beneath, turns to the right to witness the coronation in the central panel. In a roundel above, an angel crosses its arms in veneration.
This delicately modeled Madonna and Child displays a type of hushed beauty lost with the advent of the High Renaissance style in Italy. Once artists began using one-point perspective to present landscapes, architecture, and figures in three well-rounded dimensions, painting became a window on the physical world rather than merely the spiritual one.  In an effort to "open up" the scene, the artist from Paolo Uccello's workshop placed a landscape behind the Virgin and Christ. Instead of trying to show depth, however, the countryside simply forms a pattern of almost abstract trees and zigzags. The resulting design has a flatness and regularity that subtly enlivens the picture and complements the elusive three-dimensionality of the figure group.  An earlier owner of this painting partly rubbed off the Madonna's bronze halo during a cleaning, perhaps assuming that there would be gold underneath.
The stern-faced man looking slightly off to his right with noble bearing strikes the viewer with his forthrightness and candor. The deep crow's feet, creased forehead, and sagging skin suggest a mature age, while his modest, short-cropped hair and the lack of ornamentation speak of a stoic conservatism. Above all, the representation establishes the sitter's moral authority. The distinctive mole at the corner of the left eye suggests that the subject is Cicero, the famous Roman orator, statesman, lawyer, and poet. According to the Roman historian Plutarch, Cicero's name derived from a description of the mole in Latin as cicer, or chickpea, a feature of the subject which became standard in Renaissance depictions.  German Renaissance sculptor Conrat Meit carved the Head of a Man in emulation of busts from the Roman Republican period; this period favored a stark style with unmarked eyeballs and forward-combed hair. The starfish pattern on the back of the head is also typical of ancient busts. This kind of bust, which has been reset on a modern support, would have probably decorated the interior of a noble residence.
Gian Lorenzo Bernini was just twenty-three years old when he received one of his first commissions to make a full-sized bust of Pope Paul V, the recently deceased uncle of his most important patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese. In this two-and-a-half foot marble portrait, Bernini depicts the pope almost bareheaded, his hair styled in the "tonsure of St. Peter," a practice that signified the renunciation of worldly fashion, and dressed in traditional pontifical vestments. The thick cope covering his shoulders is richly decorated with embroidery of the patron saints of Rome, the Apostles Peter (holding his keys and a book) and Paul (holding the sword of his martyrdom and a book). While he is robed in the garments of the papacy, Pope Paul V gazes at the viewer with a natural expression, his face individualized by the slight turn of his head, the delicate contours of his forehead and the tiny wrinkles carved around his eyes. At this time, Bernini is already making the dynamic sculptures for which he will become famous, yet here his subject requires restraint. The artist's subdued dynamism can best be seen in the folds of drapery at the sitter's left shoulder, suggesting his body moves underneath. This bust was kept in the Village Borghese in Rome until 1893 and then sold. Its whereabouts have been unknown until its rediscovery in late 2014.
Five comedians have just finished their performance in a verdant park on the outskirts of Paris and look expectantly at their audience. Pierrot, the clown in a baggy white suit, is already holding his hat in his hand, hoping that a few coins might be thrown into it. Flanking Pierrot are four other performers dressed as characters from the Italian commedia dell'arte, which enjoyed great popularity in 18th-century Paris. Brighella wears a splendid greenish-gold suit and shoulder cape trimmed with black stripes. Mezzetin strums a few chords on his guitar, while Harlequin in a black mask with its horsehair eyebrows and moustache peers over his shoulder. A mock Spanish costume of black velvet with a white ruff identifies the figure on the far right as Scaramouche. The actors penetrate our world with an intense humanity and vivid reality, far removed from the theatrical artifice and caprice of the stage they have just left.
An artist in Lorenzo di Credi's large workshop probably made this painting under the master's direction, adapting elements from various other paintings. The apprentice or journeyman took the composition from an altarpiece begun by another artist and finished by Lorenzo. The two landscapes in the background look quite different, since they derive from two different landscape traditions. The apprentice copied the landscape with a water mill on the right from an altarpiece by Hans Memling, whose Northern Europeans landscape paintings were being imported to Florence around this time, and took the landscape on the left from other works by Lorenzo. The anonymous artist adopted Leonardo da Vinci's early color scheme of delicate light blue, red, and pale violet for the Madonna's garments.
Several subjects coexist in this painting: the Madonna of Humility, the Nativity, and the Annunciation to the Shepherds. As the Madonna of Humility, the Virgin sits upon the ground, her hands folded in worship. Presenting the Nativity, a sleeping Saint Joseph is shown at the left and an ox and donkey can be seen in the stable at the right. In the distance, a night landscape depicts shepherds receiving word of Christ's birth. Gentile da Fabriano's Madonna has a monumental grandeur, but the naturalism of this depiction makes it more innovative than the more decorative versions he had painted before. Here, Gentile reduced the amount of gold leaf in the background and included a wider vista behind the Madonna, conveying a greater sense of depth.
The subject of this bust, sprouting from a cluster of palm leaves, looks out with an expression revealing the intelligence, compassion, and strength for which she became known in Victorian England. An extraordinary Jamaican woman, Mary Seacole traveled extensively in Central and South America, where she learned to treat yellow fever and cholera. During the Crimean War, she followed the troops as a sutler, one of the many people offering hospitality services and running inns, bars, and restaurants. In the Ukraine, in addition to running a hotel, she supplied medical services to British troops on the front line, remaining even longer than her fellow nurse Florence
Although represented in the artificial format of a bust, cut off at mid-chest, the marble statue of Jacob van Reygersberg nevertheless strikes the viewer with its extraordinary realism. The sculptor Rombout Verhulst conveyed the figure's motion and spontaneity through the twisted head, furrowed brow, and pursed lips. Verhulst's facility in differentiating textures--Van Reygersberg's shield has a smooth hardness, his cravat a lacy delicacy, and his skin an unusual, satiny texture-heightens the realism. Decorative scrolls, which also lead the viewer's gaze up toward the subject's face, is soften the figure's sudden truncation at mid-chest. Jacob van Reygersberg was a wealthy provincial politician who had recently been sent to the States General, the national governing body of the Netherlands, to represent the Dutch province of Zeeland. His armor identifies him as a member of the noble class.
Joseph Ducreux experimented with the traditional limitations of the genre of self-portraiture by creating an expressive, humorous, and rather unorthodox image of himself stretching and yawning. Dressed informally in a turban and bright red jacket, Ducreux, in the midst of a huge yawn, opens his mouth wide, contorting his face with the effort and stretching his right arm toward the viewer. Holding this exaggerated pose, his back sways and his stomach pushes forward; his entire body presses up close to the surface of the picture. Ducreux was interested in the study of physiognomy and frequently used his own features as a convenient means to observe various expressions. In fact, he executed dozens of similarly exaggerated self-portraits throughout his career. A contemporary critic admired this self-portrait for its warmth, color, and expression, but later critics complained about the repetition of the subject.
Writing to his friend Daniel de Monfreid, Paul Gauguin referenced in an almost offhand way this startling painting of a decapitated human head, which he made during his first stay in Polynesia in the early 1890s. Real events, from Tahitian King Pomare V's death soon after Gauguin's arrival, to the artist having witnessed a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, likely influenced its dark subject matter. Gauguin added the Tahitian words "Arii" and "Matamoe" in the canvas' upper left. The first means "noble;" the second, "sleeping eyes," a phrase that implies "death." The notion of a human head ritually displayed in an ornate interior suggests the formality of a ruler lying in state, supported by the presence of sorrowful figures in the background. However, this scene doesn't correspond to actual accounts of Pomare V's funeral because the body wasn't decapitated. Gauguin was just as apt to fantasize about life in Polynesia as he was to document it. Bright reds, yellows, and pinks are juxtaposed with muted browns and purples to evoke a tropical sensibility. The rough, burlap-like canvas also hints at an exotic "primitivism." In his collage-illustrated book Noa Noa--which he began after his first trip to Tahiti--he included a copy of this painting and a comment that he thought of Pomare's death as a metaphor for the loss of native culture due to European colonization. Symbolist artists, including Gauguin, had a predilection for images of decapitated heads and any associated figures, such as Orpheus and John the Baptist. But in a more general sense, Gauguin also freely mixed Eastern and Western imagery. His obsession with the theme of death, which appears throughout his Tahitian paintings, is less a reference to spiritual beliefs or to what he saw around him than perhaps more significantly, how he viewed himself. Gauguin thought of himself as a martyr victimized by modern society, which compelled him to escape to a "primitive" culture.
Saint Andrew is identified by his attributes of a cross and a book. The cross refers to his martyrdom by crucifixion. The Saint Andrew panel was originally part of the upper right tier of a large altarpiece commissioned by a wealthy public officer for a church in Pisa. St. Andrew's haunting gaze in this painting is turned toward Christ on the cross, shown in the altarpiece's upper middle panel. Other panels of the fifteen-foot-tall altarpiece are in museums throughout Europe. The modulation of light and shadow in Saint Andrew's robe gives the illusion of physical weight and solidity to the figure underneath. Masaccio was famous for his innovative depiction of three-dimensional forms in painting and his ability to portray figures with convincing physical and emotional presence.
In 1783 Louis XVI commissioned an impressive new dinner service for the palace of Versailles, including this wine bottle cooler. By the time the king was executed in 1793, less than half of the proposed 442 pieces had been completed by the S�vres Porcelain Manufactory. For example, of the twenty-four wine coolers ordered, only nine were ever finished. Wine coolers were placed on the table or sideboard and filled with ice or cold water to chill the wine. Both the dark, even background color and the detailed reserve scenes are of the very highest quality and indicate that this wine cooler was made for a royal client. The dark blue ground color, known in the factory archives as beau bleu (beautiful blue), was extremely difficult to fire. Without careful application, the color became patchy and uneven in the kiln or could bleed into other areas of the design. The central reserves are carefully painted with scenes from classical antiquity: one illustrates Hercules while the other shows Mentor. The reserve "Mentor at Salentum" is from an engraving by Jean-Baptiste Tilliard, after a painting by Charles Monnet. The reserve scene "Hercules" is based on an engraving by Georg Haas, after a painting by Jean-Baptiste-Marie Pierre. Gilding has been attributed to �tienne-Henri Le Guay.
The painted roundel in the center of this diamond-shaped wood panel features a rider in classical attire on a galloping white horse. A panel of this format usually depicted a coat of arms, but here it was adopted for a personal emblem. The unbridled horse-symbolic of vigor, ambition, or passion-carries a rider whose individualized features suggest it might be a portrait. Below, a cartouche holds the Italian inscription E cosi desio me mena (And so desire carries me along) taken from Petrarch's Canzoniere, written about 1342. The patron who commissioned the panel was probably a scholar and a humanist familiar with this text. The Allegory of Passion has a rich history of ownership. On the back of the panel is the monogram HP, which stands for Henry, Prince of Wales, the older brother of Charles I and one of the first serious art collectors in England. Richard Symonds, a British diarist, next mentioned the painting as being seen in the "Closett of the Lady Anne Mary Howard" at Arundel House in London in 1653.
Pierre-Auguste Renoir depicted the self-assured composer Albert Cahen d'Anvers, a former pupil of C�sar Franck, nonchalantly smoking a cigarette at a friend's home. Traditionally, portraits of men were somber, but Renoir combined decorativeness with fidelity to his sitter's appearance. Facial hair was regarded as a powerful indicator of male sexuality, and Renoir shows Cahen d'Anvers's curled mustache echoing the wallpaper's curves, his ruffled red hair referring to the potted plant's feathery leaves. Cahen d'Anvers's authority and status are suggested through his alert, commanding gaze and details such as his elaborate cigarette holder and cravat. Renoir hoped that success in portraiture would lead to success in the wider potential market attracted by the Salon. Twenty years into his career, he had become so disenchanted with Impressionism that he called the movement a "blind alley." He modified his style, combining the loose, painterly effects of early works such as La Promenadewith Renaissance painting's firm contours and weighty forms. He began receiving portrait commissions, often from wealthy Jewish patrons. Only a year after making this portrait, however, his uncertainty about achieving his aims through portraiture and his increasing anti-Semitism meant that portraiture no longer appeared so promising to him.
During his devotions in the wilderness, Saint Bruno, the founder of the Carthusian order, a monastic community committed to solitary meditation, experienced a vision. Gazing intensely up at the sky, the saint tentatively reaches out to touch the mystical illusion of angels appearing in the sky. To the left, two tall trees cross each other at an angle, forming a cross. Below the rolling clouds, hills and land gently recede into the distance. The painter Pier Francesco Mola won fame in Rome for his rich landscapes and dramatic cloud formations, based on the Venetian landscape tradition. He painted Saint Bruno's white robes with long, smooth vertical sweeps of the brush, creating a landscape of the soft, heavy fabric.
The goddess Venus tries to restrain her lover Adonis from going off to the hunt. She clings to him, imploring him not to go, but Adonis looks down at her impassively. His dogs strain at their leashes, echoing his impatience, as detailed in the tragic love story found in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Cupid sleeps in the background, a symbol of Adonis's resistance to Venus's entreaties, since his ineffective arrows hang uselessly in a tree. The story ends tragically; during the hunt, the mortal Adonis is fatally gored by a wild boar. Titian's loose, energetic brushstrokes give the painting a sense of spontaneity and movement. In some areas, as in Adonis�s arm, the artist even painted with his finger. The composition's dynamism springs from the torsion caused by Venus's awkward pose, which was inspired by an ancient sculptural relief. Titian used rich colors, shimmering highlights, and a lush landscape to create the painting's evocative, poignant mood.
Agostino Pallavicini, a member of the Genoese branch of the Pallavicini family and the future doge of Genoa, sits enveloped by the sumptuous, flowing red robes worn in his role as ambassador to the pope. The wide expanse of fabric, spectacularly rendered, seems to have a life of its own and almost threatens to take over the painting. The luxurious swirl of cloth, its brilliant sheen, and the way it glimmers and reflects light display Anthony van Dyck's virtuosity as a painter. The family coat of arms seen on the drapery behind the sitter at the left, along with other documented portraits, firmly establishes Pallavicini's identity. In 1621, Van Dyck left Antwerp and traveled to Italy, where he stayed for five years, viewing large private collections of Italian paintings and painting various portraits. This was one of the first paintings he made in Italy, painted in 1621 to commemorate the sitter's service as an ambassador to the newly elected Pope Gregory XV.
Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, sits in a rocky landscape with his wife, Ariadne. He holds grapes and a wine cup, while she squeezes grapes into a ewer of wine at her side. She wears the golden crown--set with red gems to look like roses--that Bacchus gave her upon their marriage. In addition to this bronze, Piamontini also created a large marble group of the same composition, signed and dated 1732, now in a private collection. The sculptor arranged the two figures not to be seen from all sides but primarily from a single viewpoint in front. Despite the shallowness of the composition, the figures gracefully twist on their axes. Ariadne in particular assumes the form of a corkscrew, with her knees bending to her right and her shoulders swinging to the left. As was characteristic of sculpture at this time, the figures' bodies are much more expressive than their faces, which are emotionally blank. Porcelain copies of this group were produced by the Ginori Porcelain Manufactory at Doccia.
Saint Luke, one of the four evangelists and the patron saint of painters, is shown in the act of writing his Gospel. His attribute, a winged ox in the lower left-hand corner, holds a black inkpot for his pen. A decorative punchmarked halo, made by lightly tapping metal punches onto a gold background with a hammer, surrounds the saint's head.  The Saint Luke panel was probably one section of a five-part, portable polyptych. The panels were attached to one another by leather straps and could be folded up and carried. The back and sides of the Saint Luke panel were painted to resemble porphyry. When the polyptych was folded up, it resembled a stack of purple stone tablets. Simone Martini was famous for his graceful, refined compositions. A gentle sweep of line defines the saint's body from his neck down to his elongated left hand.
As a young artist in Switzerland, Hans Holbein the Younger is known to have made designs for stained glass. This is the only known surviving stained-glass portrait panel associated with him. It shows a male figure dressed in the habit of a canon (member of a religious order primarily charged with assisting at divine worship). He wears a pleated surplice (loose white garment with wide sleeves) over a cassock (clerical robe with a high buttoned collar), a hooded fir cape (almutium) fastened with a cord around the neck, and a cap. The figure is shown kneeling while holding a book open in his hands, as if participating in a religious service. He kneels on a short arcaded plinth at the foot of an ornate column, all set against a blue damask-patterned background below a gold tablet hanging from a green tasseled cord. The tablet is inscribed in black Gothic lettering, Stift vo Ber(eim[?]), possibly an abbreviation for �Stift von Berkheim� (monastery of Berkheim). This may refer to the Premonstratensian (a Roman Catholic religious order) abbey in Rot an der Rot near the town of Berkheim in Southern Germany, not far from the Swiss border. The curious figures behind the canon show a nude woman riding on the back of a bearded male sea monster with a curling yellow tail fin, who holds a tortoiseshell shield and the jaw bone of an animal. They seem to be derived from a print by Albrecht D�rer, The Sea Monster, of about 1498; their significance in this scene has not been determined. The two small pieces in the lower left corner appear to be fragments from another window, possibly from the same series, that later were incorporated into the current panel.
The son of God is represented seated on heaven's throne, with his right hand raised, palm faced outward with three fingers extended. This gesture communicated a particular message to medieval Catholics in Western Europe. It is part of an iconographic pose called in Latin the "Maiestas Domini," or "Christ in Majesty," to symbolize his role in presiding over the human souls of all time. Images like this decorated altar frontals in Romanesque churches as a somber reminder of the coming Day of Judgment. In this gilded copper representation, Christ holds a jeweled Bible and his feet rest on an ornate enamel plaque. This Christ in Majesty served as the centerpiece of an ensemble of 52 saint and apostle figures. Together they were commissioned for the high altar of a cathedral in Orense, Spain, a stop along a famous pilgrimage route. Artisans in Limoges, France, a renowned center for the production of enamel, created this plaque and its ensemble. Most of the surviving figures lack inset pieces of glass that decorate Christ's tunic, but have similar, bead-like eyes. Visually they all relate to one another, with highly ornamental enameled backgrounds, similar to the plaque at Christ's feet. Their patterns are also dark and light blue, with white, gold, green, and red-brown accents. This figure was formed from a single sheet of copper hammered on the reverse side to create the raised design in front. Features such as the beard, mustache, and folds of the tunic are etched into its surface. Large areas of gilding have worn away, primarily on the raised surfaces, suggesting that this object was touched over many centuries by the faithful who prayed before it.
This armored warrior on horseback holding a shield with Medusa's head probably represents a figure from myth or ancient history, perhaps the Roman hero Marcus Curtius. The horse and rider's out-flung limbs create intersecting diagonal axes, conveying a sense of explosive movement. To balance the composition, the rider sits far back on the horse. This position also assures the stability of the bronze, the weight of which rests solely on the horse's two rear legs. Although the rider's lithe, attenuated body expresses a Mannerist conception of anatomical proportions, the composition's vigorous thrusting is more typical of the Baroque. Artisans cast the piece in several sections using the lost-wax method, then joined the separate pieces with plugs. The surface shows little evidence of much chasing after casting.
Two brightly colored figural groups from the Ginori Porcelain factory depict violent episodes from the Roman poet Ovid's Metamorphoses. Modeled in porcelain, Jupiter's messenger Mercury attacks Argus on one pedestal, while Perseus kills Medusa on another. The factory reused Giovanni Battista Foggini's bronze casting molds, replicating the Baroque sculptor's muscular figures, wind-blown dramatic draperies, and dynamic compositions. Yet the painting, using jewel-like yellow, purple, blue, and pink pigments and gilding, brings out a spirited delicacy more typical of the Rococo style of the mid-1700s. As a result, Medusa, whose horrifying look was reputed to turn men to stone, is merely a rather startlingly rosy-cheeked woman with snakes for hair, while Argus, the hundred-eyed giant who tormented Jupiter's lover Io, is a handsome, muscled warrior. Each figural group is made from ten separate sections, each of which was press-molded and fired before being joined together. The figures are joined to Rococo bases with candle sockets, indicating that they were meant to function as part of a candelabrum. The two lively groups would have been a dramatic centerpiece for a dinner-table setting. The group was painted in the shop of Johann Karl Wendelin Anreiter von Zirnfeld.
Made of soft-paste porcelain, this large bust was probably fired in the kilns of Mennecy, which were only 22.5 centimeters high. As this sculpture is 42.5 centimeters tall, the king's bust had to be fired separately from the base and then joined together above the crown. The king's head sunk slightly in the kiln, giving him a rather raised ribcage. Louis XV appears at the height of his powers, at about the age of forty. The bust was probably inspired by a marble sculpture by Jacques-Fran�ois-Joseph Sally, which was erected in the town of Valenciennes in 1752. The decorations on the plinth include the arms of France beneath the crown surrounded by swords, a cannon, drums, and battle standards.
Pietro Bernini and his gifted son Gian Lorenzo carved this marble boy with a dragon for the palace of Maffeo Barberini, later Pope Urban VIII. Hercules, who demonstrated his divine strength even as an infant by slaying poisonous serpents, appears here as a mischievous boy who smiles, sits on the dragon, and breaks its jaw with his bare hands. Common in Hellenistic statuary, the theme of Hercules and the serpent was revived in sculpture of the early 1600s.This work was presented as a diplomatic gift by Cardinal Carlo Barberini, grandnephew of Pope Urban VIII, to King Philip V of Spain when he entered Naples in 1702.
Three boats approach the German city of Cologne where Saint Ursula, on her way back north after a pilgrimage to Rome, was martyred with the strike of an arrow. Ursula sits under a baldachin in the stern of the foreground boat; two of her virgin companions reach out toward the shore. The middle boat carries Pope Ciriacus and his bishops. More of Ursula's attendants follow in the last boat. Banners depicting the arms of Ursula and Ciriacus fly from the bow of each vessel.  Originally forming the left wing of a triptych with the Crucifixion in the center, this panel was made for the church of Sant'Orsola in Florence. The subject, although common in Northern Europe, was rare in Tuscany. Daddi's treatment of the subject is also quite unusual. The panel is filled with surprising, naturalistic details like the frothing river produced by the oars and the boat's advancing prow.
These panels once formed the pinnacles of the wings of a now-dismembered portable altarpiece. A double-tiered central panel originally depicted the Madonna and Child below a Crucifixion. The triple-tiered side panels featured pairs of standing saints, with the Getty Museum's Annunciation panels forming the apex. Kneeling, the Archangel Gabriel greets the Virgin at the moment of Christ's Incarnation. In the form of a dove, the Holy Spirit descends, flying close to the Virgin's face. Paolo Veneziano skillfully placed his figures within the difficult confines of the small trapezoidal space. The depiction of Mary's throne presented a challenge to the artist, but he set it at an angle thus, giving a sense of depth. He used the space above Gabriel by sweeping the angel's wings upwards so that the feathery ends touch the point where the frame meets the panel. The Virgin's facial features, her hieratic pose, and the decorative patterning of her dress and the cloth of honor draping her throne all illustrate Byzantine conventions of the past. But the figure of Gabriel shows a more modern influence: The innovations of Giotto and other Tuscan artists are seen in the way Veneziano has given the figure a weightiness and bulk achieved through sculptural modeling.
"My temperament compels me to look for and take pleasure in well-ordered things. I avoid confusion, which is contrary and opposed to my nature, just as light is opposed to the darkness of night," wrote Nicolas Poussin. Saint John baptizes the multitudes in an ideal landscape, framed by a tree trunk on each side. Clothed in antique costumes, the orderly followers have arranged themselves into a carefully balanced frieze. As always, Poussin approached this religious work from the tradition of order, clarity, and harmony associated with the art of ancient Greece and Rome. Poussin painted this religious scene for one of his key patrons, Roman antiquarian and scientist Cassiano dal Pozzo. Also in the 1630s, Poussin painted a series of the Seven Sacraments for Cassiano, to which this canvas may be related.
The suicide of Lucretia is represented next to a donor�s coat of arms with scenes of the Creation of Eve and the Temptation in the Garden in the top left and right corners. The inscription below includes the name of the donor, Friolin Kleger, and the date 1561. Kleger was a deputy regional governor of the Gaster region in the canton of St Gallen, Switzerland. The story of Lucretia, a virtuous Roman wife who chose suicide over living in disgrace after being raped by a corrupt court official, was seen as heralding the founding of the ancient Roman Republic that rebelled against the tyranny of the king. Pairing the classical legend of Lucretia with the biblical scenes of Eve is likely indicative of Humanist thought addressing universal themes of virtue and vice. The Republican overtones (appropriate to the Swiss confederacy) and advocacy of moral rectitude no doubt carried a political message in relation to the patron, and the panel may have originally hung in a civic building such as a city hall. The figure of Lucretia derives directly from a print by Hans Sebald Beham (German, 1500-1550), and the upper left scene relates to a print The Creation of Eve by Hans Brosamer (German, about 1500-1552).
As the innkeeper looks on, the resurrected Christ reveals himself to his apostles Cleophas and Saint Peter, as described in the Gospel of Luke: "When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him." The artist heightens the scene's tension by positioning the table at the very front of the picture plane, hemming in the substantial figures.  It is thought that Bartolomeo Cavarozzi painted this painting, which is after Caravaggio's innovative treatment of the subject that is now in the National Gallery, London. During the 1600s, Caravaggio's original was in Rome, where it was seen and copied by many artists. The Getty Museum's picture follows the original closely, but with several important differences. The positioning of the three figures surrounding Christ has been reversed. These figures are also shown from a slightly lower viewpoint than Caravaggio's, making them more monumental. This painting has less spatial depth and a more symmetrical composition than Caravaggio's original. The artist also enlarged and lavished great attention on the still life, capturing the play of light across a range of textures and surfaces.
A short-lived Parisian earthenware manufactory probably made these portrait busts of Louis XV and his queen, Marie Leczinska. Its 1747 inventory listed such busts of the French king and queen. Louis XV appears as a youthful military leader, wearing armor and the ribbon of the Order of the Holy Spirit. The factory's modelers based this figure on a bronze model cast by Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne. The queen wears a low-cut court dress under loose drapery fastened by a brooch. Separately modeled and fired socles with lions crouching behind shields support the busts.
Venus twists on the bed in a curved yet inviting pose, and Mars extends his limbs below, with a putto aiding him to disrobe. The bodies of these mythological lovers respond to each other in their similar anticipatory gestures, creating a dynamic experience of space. The composition's bold diagonal, from the maidservant airing the bedclothes at the top left to Mars's armor at the bottom right, further enhances the scene's sense of drama and spatial depth. Palma Il Giovane perpetuated many elements of Tintoretto's style, such as the sexual magnetism that galvanizes this entire canvas. Palma painted few mythological subjects, probably for a small circle of his intellectual friends. The poet Giambattista Marino spent time in Venice from 1606 to 1607, and Palma may have painted this canvas for him.
In this painting, El Greco combines the iconic power of the crucifix with the expressive power of landscape painting. He sets the cross atop Golgotha, the "place of the skull," with Jerusalem looming in the background. He eliminates the other characters from the biblical narrative, encouraging the viewer to contemplate Christ and his suffering.El Greco's dramatic colors and exaggerated proportions distort the figure, illustrating the transcendent moments before death, when Christ sublimated his physical pain and commended his spirit to God. Light plays across his undulating form, illuminating his tortured body against the dark background. Storm clouds mass around his body, whose glowing pallor is echoed in the dramatic flashes of light playing through the sky. His eyes turned heavenward, Christ looks away from the bones and skulls that lie at his feet, to emphasize his triumph over death.El Greco and his studio produced several variations of this subject. The significance of the horses and riders carrying a standard in the distance is unknown, though it is repeated in most versions of this composition. The painting was unknown prior to being purchased by a Spanish family at a flea market around 1950. It remained in their possession until the year 2000, when it was acquired by the Getty Museum.
Little is known about the life of this Italian painter, who was originally from Brescia but appears to have spent most of his career in Venice. He is recognized for his skill in painting twilit scenes like this one, in which a large figure of a shepherd is set against a darkened sky, gazing wearily out toward the viewer. Resting his left arm on a staff, seemingly tired from his day�s work, the shepherd loosely holds a flute. With his right hand he gestures towards a farmhouse in the background, behind which imaginary ancient ruins loom. Though better known for religious subjects, here Salvoldo presents a genre scene, perhaps influenced by contemporary Flemish artists.The figure of the shepherd is clearly delineated against his surroundings and appears almost luminous in the evening light. Savoldo�s use of deep, rich colors and expressive textures show the influence of contemporary Venetian painters, such as Titian (1485�1576) and Lorenzo Lotto (1480�1556). The musical shepherd was perhaps meant to idealize and celebrate the charms of pastoral life for a sophisticated urban audience. Paintings of this type became popular in Venice in the early sixteenth century, when interest in pastoral poetry and drama also began to flourish.
In the foreground of this minutely detailed painting, a maid attempts to revive an elegant young woman who has fainted. In the background, a doctor examines a vial of the woman's urine. The dandyish doctor, whose ostentatious clothing suggests that he is a quack, was a stock figure in contemporary theater, and his inclusion here adds a touch of buffoonery. An erotic painting hangs above the fireplace, hinting that the woman suffers from lovesickness. A crying girl seen in the right background holds a burning ribbon, which was understood at the time as a symbol of pregnancy.Frans van Mieris the Elder was well known for his finely painted works and genre pictures like this one. He often presented a theatrical and humorous view of daily life among the prosperous Dutch.
This painting is part of a series of works executed by Gentileschi in 1622 for Giovanni Antonio Sauli�s Genoese Palazzo which includes the Getty�s Lot and His Daughters and a painting now in a private collection, The Penitent Magdalene.The subject is based on a passage in Ovid�s Metamorphoses, in which King Acrisius of Argos imprisoned his beautiful daughter in order to avoid the Oracle�s prophesy that she would give birth to a son who would kill him. In the story, Jupiter takes the form of a shower of gold and impregnates Dana�, who then gives birth to Perseus. This subject was often exploited by artists as an opportunity to depict an erotic female nude. Here, Cupid pulls back the luxuriant dark green curtain to allow the god to enter the bedchamber, and the viewer too is invited to witness the moment of seduction. A transparent veil is draped across Dana�, though rather than covering her modesty, the fabric creates a tantalizing and sensual focal point on her body. The picture is a meticulous study of light, surface effects and color; the artist skillfully renders the sheen of the fabrics, ranging from the gold bedcover to the cool white linen sheet and deep crimson mattress.
The nude played a central role in Paul C�zanne's art throughout his career, but, paradoxically for an artist who usually drew from life, he seldom used nude models in his working process: he was said to be ill-at-ease with naked sitters. "I paint still lifes," he once told Renoir, "Women models frighten me." Cezanne contented instead with studying earlier artists and using the drawings after nude models that he had made in art school in Paris. The meaning of this enigmatic painting is unclear, and it has been known by several titles. This woman is confronted by devotees from different arts and occupations, among them a mitered bishop, whose admiration seems intrusive, even aggressive. A painter sometimes identified as Eug�ne Delacroix stands at his easel painting the scene. The bald figure at the painting's bottom may be C�zanne himself. Whether she encourages their adoration, passively accepts it, or is trapped by her cult is unclear. Like many of C�zanne's nudes, the woman's face is nearly blank, except for her red eye sockets. Around 1877 C�zanne began to use the parallel diagonal strokes seen here to impose order and to unify his picture's surface.
A charming and persuasive speaker, James Christie founded the fine arts auction house in London that still bears his name. He was a close friend and neighbor of Thomas Gainsborough, who painted this portrait. Gainsborough depicted the cultivated auctioneer leaning on one of the artist's own landscape paintings and holding a piece of paper in his right hand, perhaps an auction list. Christie wears a sober brown frock suit, a white linen shirt, and a formal wig. On the little finger of his left hand is a signet ring, and two pendant seals dangle from watches worn about his waist. His dress and jewelry befit a cosmopolitan English gentleman of the 1770s. The Portrait of James Christie hung in a place of honor at Christie's auction house in London. The auction house was a gathering place for collectors, dealers, and fashionable society. The portrait immortalized the auctioneer and perpetuated his association with Gainsborough, who was one of England's most famous portrait painters.
Using soft, broad strokes of black chalk, Pontormo built up the figure of a young man lying on his right side, propping himself up on his elbow. Ambiguous facial features indicate that Pontormo was more interested in the figure's posture than in a true likeness of an individual. Pontormo made this drawing as a preparatory study for a scene of the martyrdom of Saint Lawrencefor theCertosa del Galluzzo, a monastery outside Florence. However, it was Pontormo's pupil Bronzino who executed the finished fresco. Saint Lawrence is usually depicted as a young man. According to legend, Lawrence was a third-century Roman deacon who was responsible for distributing goods to the poor. When a greedy high-ranking official demanded that Lawrence give him the church's treasure, Lawrence presented a group of poor people, saying that they were the church's treasure. For this defiant act, he was arrested and tortured on a burning gridiron. In the finished work, Bronzino made only small changes to Pontormo's composition. Bronzino's figure lies on a gridiron and turns his head to the left, as he is crowned by a cherub. He holds a palm leaf in his left hand, an emblem of martyrdom. Pontormo's drawing probably provided Bronzino with a model for human musculature and proportions that artists strived to achieve in the 1500s.
When Christ paused to rest at Jacob's Well, a holy site for both Samaritans and Jews, he requested a drink of water from a Samaritan woman. Though she was initially surprised, since Jews and Samaritans were traditionally enemies, she became increasingly intrigued by the knowledgeable and all-seeing visitor as they talked. Believing him to be a prophet, she spoke of looking forward to the coming of the Messiah. "I am he, the one who is speaking to you," Jesus replied.  Against the sober classical ruins, Alessandro Magnasco gave the scene an expressive urgency with his characteristically agitated drapery and rapidly sketched, attenuated musculature. Magnasco took the subjects of both this painting and its pendant, Noli Me Tangere, from the New Testament Gospel of John. A collaborator probably painted the background of antique ruins in both pictures.
Saint Catherine of Siena, a Christian mystic and lay member of the Dominican Order, appears in half-length in the lower right corner, gazing upward at the Crucifixion taking place high in the mountains. She holds a lily and a miniature crucifix identical to the one above. Hands folded in prayer, the wounds of her stigmata are visible on her palms. The viewer's eyes follow Saint Catherine's gaze, turned to the Virgin who looks up at Christ. Saint John the Evangelist, in a bright red and green garment, looks out sorrowfully and gestures towards the observer. Like the visionary Saint Catherine, the viewer is invited to contemplate the universal significance of Christ's suffering. Behind the figures, an extensive Italian landscape, elaborated with a winding river and a town, stretches into the background. To contrast with the somewhat static quality of the figures, Marco Pino has painted a tempestuous sky, dark blue near the top and gradually lightening into pink and yellow at the horizon, representing the darkness that came over the land for three hours when Jesus died.
With convincing naturalism, a cow turns its head to survey a group of figures resting above a crevice on a hillside. The satyr sleeps with his head on the lap of a nymph, and a young child playfully tugs at her arm. Cows and sheep rest around the family, completing the image of peaceful tranquility in this arcadian landscape. On the right side of the painting, trees grow at different angles on a rocky hillside sloping diagonally down toward a crevice or dry creek bed. In the far distance, hazy mountains give way to a light-blue sky with grayish-white clouds. Nicolaes Berchem was fond of depicting idylls in imaginary Italian settings. The foliage and hilly landscape identify the location as typical of northern Italy, not Holland. Here he used a vertical format and suggested movement through the diagonals of the hillside and leaning trees. Framed by the large open expanse on the left, the standing cow, rather than the family group in the foreground, captures the viewer's attention.
Wearing a magnificent silk robe with an ermine lining, King Solomon kneels and makes an offering to a pagan idol. One of his wives appears to instruct him, while several other concubines, lavishly dressed, stand behind. A group of men in elaborate headpieces and rich finery watch Solomon and the women from the left with displeasure, as if they know that Solomon's idol worship will eventually destroy his kingdom. The Temple of Jerusalem, which was erected under the king's reign, is under construction in the background.  Solomon was known for his proverbial wisdom and great wealth. In his later years he was increasingly drawn to the pagan cults, which were thought to have been introduced into Israel by the women who came from neighboring kingdoms to join his large harem.  This subject was popular in Protestant countries in the 1600s because it reflected Protestant disapproval of the Catholic Church's use of religious imagery, a practice that Protestants viewed as idolatrous.
The shipwrecked Trojan prince Aeneas, shown on the right, arrives at the court of Dido, the legendary queen and founder of Carthage. Hands upraised, Dido and members of her court react in surprise at the appearance of the splendidly uniformed warrior. Others point knowingly to Venus and Cupid, who appear in the upper corner. It was Cupid who made Dido fall hopelessly in love with Aeneas. Although not shown here, the episode will end sadly; prompted by Aeneas' inevitable departure, Dido commits suicide. This densely packed theatrical scene is taken from Virgil's Aeneid. Nicolas Verkolye placed the figures in a stage-like setting with classically inspired architecture. Through light, shadow, and gesture, he dramatically relates the story of the ill-fated lovers.
In a typically Sienese manner, Bernardino Fungai mingled elements of Gothic art--a tooled gold background--with the new Renaissance ideas of three-dimensionality. Fungai presented the hermit saints in three-quarter view to display his knowledge of the new concept of foreshortening, yet he retained a typically Sienese interest in decorative patterning, as seen in the Virgin's elaborate drapery. He tilted Christ's painted halo in perspective, but he incised those of the saints and the Virgin into the background. Fungai also effectively employed the characteristic linear harmonies of Sienese art in the gentle contours of the docile Virgin's mantle, the subtle scallops of her white headgear, the fluttery end of Christ's transparent drapery, and the saints' wavy beards.
The New Testament relates an occasion when, upon visiting the Temple of Jerusalem during Passover, Jesus found it filled with livestock and turned into a marketplace by merchants and money changers. Furious that the sacred place had been turned into a �den of thieves�, Christ fashioned a whip out of cords, and drove them from the temple, overturning tables as he went. In this animated composition, the diagonal thrust of Christ�s movement through the crowd, and the monumental figures reeling in his wake, Bernardino Mei convincingly conveys Christ's righteous anger.This was a popular subject amongst other contemporary seventeenth-century painters, because it offered an opportunity to illustrate a scene laden with tumultuous action and intense emotion. Following the Counter Reformation, it was also seen as symbolic of the recent overhaul of the Catholic Church. Features such as the half-length figures, their unidealized faces, and their positioning in the extreme foreground are borrowed from the Caravaggesque tradition. Mei deviates from this tradition, however, by bathing his composition in unifying, silvery light, which harmonizes the colors, and makes the painting distinctly different in character to works by Caravaggio and his followers, whose use of strong, directional light creates stark contrast between highlights and shadows.
As told by the Roman poet Ovid in the Metamorphoses, the lusty satyr Pan eagerly pursued the wood nymph Syrinx. Guarding her virtue, she ran until she reached a river and desperately begged her sisters of the stream to transform her. Just as Pan was about to embrace her, Syrinx changed into cattail reeds. When Pan discovered that he was holding nothing but marsh reeds, he sighed in disappointment, causing the wind to blow through the reeds. He was enchanted by the sound, believing it to be the mournful cry of his beloved Syrinx; from the reeds he fashioned a set of pipes so that he could have her with him always.  In this pendant to Diana and her Nymphs Bathing, Jean-Fran�ois de Troy represented the climax of the narrative. Syrinx, who is seen both before and after the transformation, looks fearfully at Pan as she falls into the arms of Ladon, the river god. Half in shadow, the river nymphs watch apprehensively and huddle together protectively. As he grasps the clump of cattails, Pan seems near ecstasy. The women's soft, creamy skin contrasts with Pan's dark, muscular torso and the autumnal foliage in the background.
These panels once served as wings of a portable altarpiece used for private devotion. The left panel shows Saint Francis, who is recognized by the stigmata on his hands, feet, and side. The three knots tied in the sash around his waist symbolizing his Franciscan Order's three religious vows: poverty, chastity, and obedience. An unidentified bishop saint wearing a cope and miter and holding a crozier stands to the left of Francis. The right panel depicts Saint John the Baptist, who is identified by his reed cross and tunic of animal skins, and Saint Dominic, who wears the habit of his Dominican Order. He holds a lily, the symbol of chastity, and carries a book of the Gospels. The Dominican monk Fra Angelico, whose clerical name means "Angelic Brother," was among the first to adopt Masaccio's innovative naturalism. Though he still employed a gold background, Fra Angelico used shading to model plausible figures in the round. These paintings epitomize his particular delicacy of color, sensitivity of expression, and ability to convey the spiritual grace of saints.
Genesis (39:7�20) tells how Joseph, sold into slavery by his jealous brothers, was bought by Potiphar, captain of Pharaoh's guard. Potiphar's wife (who is not named in the Bible) took a liking to the young man and made several failed attempts to seduce him. Here, Reni illustrates one such occasion�the wife clutches Joseph�s robes, pleading with him to make love to her. The virtuous Joseph turns to flee, leaving a fragment of his torn cloak in her hands. Humiliated, the vengeful wife accused Joseph of rape, using this piece of fabric as evidence. Joseph was promptly thrown into prison, where his interpretation of the dreams of other inmates eventually lead to his rise in Pharaoh's household.Moralizing narratives such as this one found popularity in seventeenth-century Europe where, in the spirit of Counter-Reformation sobriety, they served as a warning against the dangers of carnal desire and of the female temptress, and to instruct viewers on combatting the temptation of sin. This scene, however, conveys the message that virtue and integrity are not always immediately rewarded, but require patience and faith in God. The subject also proved a suitable opportunity for the Bolognese master, Guido Reni, to showcase his widely-celebrated skill in drapery painting.
Painted in 1797, this intimate and lively half-length portrait depicts the 51-year-old sculptor Philippe-Laurent Roland (1746-1816), an exact contemporary and longtime friend of Vincent's who was also his colleague in the lnstitut, which had been established in 1795 to replace the defunct Royal Academy. Roland is shown from the side, sitting with his body angled slightly toward the viewer and his proper right arm resting informally on the back of his chair. His hand, dominating the center foreground, lightly grips an ebauchoir, a sculptural tool used for working plaster. The artist's costume, consisting of a well-worn jacket, waistcoat, and loose shirt with pleated frill, is decidedly simple, dignified and workmanlike - a world apart from the extreme fashions of the strutting young peacocks who were being labeled Jncroyab/es in the late 1790s. His gray, powdered hair unpretentiously disheveled, Roland engages us directly, his self� assured expression a marvel of psychological nuance. On one hand his level gaze is cool and restrained, perhaps even faintly quizzical in his calm appraisal of the viewer, brow slightly furrowed. Yet his demeanor is also open and warm, his parted lips heightening our sense of an intelligent character caught in the moment, his guard dropping in a friendly encounter between equals.    Vincent's restricted, sober palette, typical of revolutionary-period male portraits, is likewise subtly nuanced, ranging from the cool, light grays of the background, the warm browns of Roland's jacket and the creams and whites of his waistcoat and shirt, to the ruddy flush of his cheeks and the red of the honorific ribbon pinned to the inside of his jacket, which offer a counterpoint to the dull green of the chair back. Throughout Vincent's masterful paint handling is evident, from the lightly brushed background that imparts a wonderful sense of space, to the firm, sculptural modeling of Roland's head and hand, whose three-dimensionality is emphasized by the painter's sophisticated modulation of light and shade. The resulting sense of physical acy, of vital presence, is extraordinary, and is only strengthened by the tight framing of the composition, the proximity of the sitter to the picture plane, and the suppression of superfluous details.
Intently interested in the expression of human emotion, Rembrandt often used himself as his own model in his early years as an independent master in Leiden. Here, in a small and freely painted work, he appears in the guise of a soldier, relaxed and engaging the viewer with a laugh.  For this sophisticated self-portrait, painted at age twenty-one or twenty-two, Rembrandt combines a study of character and emotion (known in Dutch as a tronie) with a rare jovial self-presentation. The lively, short brushwork in the face and brisk handling of the neutral background convey a sense of spontaneity and immediacy.  This is one of a small number of paintings by Rembrandt from the late 1620s executed on copper. He signed it in the upper-left corner with his monogram of interlocking letters, "RHL" (Rembrandt Harmenszoon Leidensis), which he used only briefly, from late 1627 to early 1629.

Savoldo depicts Mary Magdalene in the Garden of Gethsemane peering from behind shimmering folds of satin fabric, tentatively looking outward at the viewer. She is identifiable by her ointment jar on the left, containing the oil with which she anointed Christ�s feet. She stands by the sepulchre, preparing to anoint the Saviour�s body. Unbeknownst to her, Christ has risen, and she is soon to encounter him in the garden. Although Christ has not yet appeared, the strong light that bathes the left half of the painting implies his illuminating presence. The shadow cast across the Magdalene's face gives her an appearance that is at once vulnerable and mysterious, while also functioning as a metaphor for her impending enlightenment. The rich, iridescent drapery perhaps alludes to her legendary former life as a prostitute.During this period of the artist�s career, his paintings are characterized by gleaming light, vivid color and luminous, silvery tonalities. The painting�of which three other versions are known (Berlin, Gem�ldegalerie; London, The National Gallery; Florence, Gallerie degli Uffizi)�has been interpreted in a number of ways. It has been suggested that the sensual image was a portrait of a courtesan, intended as an erotically-charged piece for a male collector. It may instead reveal the artist�s efforts to showcase his talent in reinventing popular biblical themes and representing complex surface textures such as the reflective satin fabric.
The young haloed figure most likely depicts an angel, prominent auxiliary characters in religious scenes of all media during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. This is one of two similar pieces owned by the museum (Angel). The densely patterned clothing, indicative of expensive fabric, is not unusual for such figures that were often represented in elaborate ecclesiastical or royal garments appropriate to their status as heavenly attendants.
The arrest of Christ is dramatically rendered in this roundel. Adding to the urgency of the scene is the depiction of the torch held above the figures that is shown with the flames spreading sharply back as it is moved forward. The composition is after a woodcut by the artist Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen (ca. 1475-1533) of Amsterdam. The print was the fourth in his series The Round Passion of Christ.
In a verdant park at sunset, a young woman abandons herself to her tousle-haired companion�s ardent embrace. Coiled up in a pose of centrifugal energy, the impulsive lovers are oblivious to the third figure: Mezzetin, sitting on the same rocky outcrop. Drawn from the theatrical tradition of the commedia dell�arte, this character represents a poignant foil to the couple�s unbridled passion. Introverted and with a melancholy air, he tunes his guitar, knowing that his serenading will mean nothing to the lovers and serve only to heighten his own sense of lonely longing as he gazes upon them. His costume, a rose-coloured jacket and knee-britches slashed with yellow and adorned with blue ribbons as well as a lace ruff and cuffs, is reminiscent of the paintings of Anthony van Dyck. The small dog at lower right, a quotation from Rubens, watches the couple with considerably more appreciation than Mezzetin can muster.
Elegantly attired and wearing a powdered wig, Charles-Fran�ois Pinceloup de la Grange slightly raises his head and gazes searchingly into the distance. A member of the Orl�ans nobility, Pinceloup de la Grange had recently received several prestigious government appointments. The painting and a pendant portrait of the sitter's wife may have been intended to celebrate his achievement. The portrait was painted near the outset of Jean-Baptiste Perronneau's career. Primarily working in the medium of pastel, Perronneau was one of the most prominent and accomplished portraitists in eighteenth-century France. He was especially successful in securing patrons, like Pinceloup de la Grange, in the French provinces.
This drawing is a preparatory study for the figure of Saint Peter in The Madonna and Child in Glory, with Saints Peter, Bernard, Zeno and Paul in the Church of Santa Maria in Organo, Verona, dated 1533 and probably commissioned by the Della Torre Family, whose coat-of-arms appears at the lower right corner of the canvas. Sensitively drawn in back chalk, the study focuses primarily on Saint Peter's gestures and the resulting disposition of his robe and yellow cloak, examining the strong fall of light from the left, which lends them a sculptural quality. Saint Peter looks up towards the Virgin with his left arm holding a book and his right hand extended; in the painting he holds keys. Savoldo left the physiognomy of the face undescribed as he most likely drew a detailed head study for this figure (the Getty has such a head study for the figure of Saint Paul in the same altarpiece). The study is rooted in close observation, with carefully applied black and white chalk used to model the rich folds of the drapery, and robust black chalk hatching around the figures highlighting them on the sheet and producing dramatic effects of chiaroscuro.    The deeply naturalistic drawing was likely made from a studio assistant posed as Saint Peter, and on each edge of the sheet are chalk indications used for maintaining proportions as the design was transferred to the painting. Such studies were usually entirely covered in a grid of squaring, and it is rare for an artist to spare a drawing in this manner. The decision perhaps came from an intent to reuse the sheet for a figure in another painting, a common practice, or simply a desire to preserve such an extraordinarily beautiful and satisfying drawing.
Shepherd with His Dog depicts an idyllic pastoral scene, in which a young man leans against a tree stump accompanied by his dog and a sheep at his feet. The dog looks lovingly up at his master, but the youth appears to be gazing elsewhere. Perhaps he is looking in the direction of another figure, because this sculpture was intended to be one of a pair. The sculpture's companion piece, Lady Feeding a Sheep with Hay, features a shepherdess leaning on a gate feeding a pet lamb. As was customary in porcelain figure production, the two are based on an engraving-Shepherd and Shepherdess by Angelica Kauffmann. Shepherd with His Dog may also be inspired by a famous sixteenth-century Roman statue, Antinous, of a youthful-looking male in the same pose. This elegant fourteen-inch sculpture made of white biscuit porcelain was produced at the Derby Porcelain Factory in England. (Biscuit is a type of unglazed porcelain admired for its marble-like appearance.) Shepherd with His Dog is thought to have been modeled by the highly talented but little-known Swiss porcelain artist Johann Jakob Wilhelm Sp�ngler. The sculpture was originally attributed to two of Sp�ngler's contemporaries, but scholars now believe it to be Sp�ngler's work due to its refined style, graceful lines, and crisp detail.
The scroll on the plate reads "When alive, I shall be among the living, and when dead, I shall [still] be among the living." This statement is difficult to interpret; it may be a declaration of undying love, possibly for a woman who had died, or an expression of the fleeting nature of life. Busts of men and women in profile, like that seen here, often appear on ceramics. This idealized female image might reveal the influence of the work of Umbrian painters such as Perugino, who were born or worked very near the town where this plate was made. By the 1400s Hispano-Moresque lusterware was imported into Italy, where it became popular as a precious-looking but less costly alternative to vessels in gold and silver. The difficult luster process was mastered in a few places in Italy, notably Deruta and Gubbio. Whereas Gubbio luster is distinguished by its reddish-gold iridescence coupled with multi-colored decoration, Deruta luster, like this plate, more closely imitates the yellowish-gold luster and blue painting of Hispano-Moresque ceramics.
In a luxuriant park adorned with a monumental fountain, two couples perform a country dance, accompanied by the music of a rustic bagpipe. On either side, other couples play out the game of love in its various stages of anticipation, entreaty, and reward. Lancret's subject was an invention of the 1700s. Called a f�te galante,these paintings depicted a pastoral landscape peopled by elegant figures strolling, making music, or attempting to woo their partners. Participants of the f�te galante seemed uninhibited by the stiff conventions of formal society. Lancret's fluid brushstroke is evident in the shimmering highlights of the costumes and in the play of their opulent colors against the harmony of the landscape background. The painting's relatively large size suggests that it was commissioned by a prominent collector, possibly an aristocratic patron or member of the French royalty.
In the 1700s, hosts and hostesses served tea in cups such as this one. To cool a little of the hot liquid at a time, a guest would have poured some tea into the deep saucer and then drunk. Paintings known through engraved copies were popular sources for decoration on porcelain vessels in the 1700s. The porcelain painter �tienne-Jean Chabry fils (son), copied the scene on this cup from an engraving of Philip James de Loutherbourg's painting, The Cherished Lamb. The saucer, with its inscription L'Avare (The miser), refers to the comedy of the same name by Moli�re. The paintings on cups and saucers did not necessarily have to relate to each other.
A playful cupid romps in the center of this dish, while the busts of a bearded man in a turban-like hat and a bald man in classical dress gaze solemnly from the two medallions on the rim. These figures may be generalized Near Eastern types or possibly portraits of specific individuals such as the turbaned Mohammed II, sultan of the Ottoman Turks, and the bald John VIII Paleologus, the Byzantine emperor. The colors on this dish are exceptionally vibrant and jewel-like. The artist achieved this effect by applying a final transparent glaze to the piece, which enhances the brilliance of the colors and the sheen of the surface.
Leaning back, Venus, goddess of love and beauty, gently twists her head to look at the small wreath she holds aloft in her left hand. Nude, her drapery falling down upon her legs, she rests on a rock amidst seashells. According to myth, Venus was born from the foam of the sea, an aspect of her legend suggested by the sculpture's title, Venus Marina. Although cupid or a dolphin usually accompanies Venus Marina, neither are present here. This tabletop bronze was made after a model attributed to the French sculptor Robert Le Lorrain. As was characteristic of the Rococo period, the sculpture is a subtle work with no large movements or heroic story. A restrained sensuality of delicate curves and flowing drapery dominates as the sculptor focused on small variations of texture and line. He contrasted, for example, the complex shape and rough texture of the striated rock with Venus's smooth skin and simple open forms. Other similar Venus figures attest to the popularity of this genre of sculpture in France in the early 1700s.
An unknown potter formed this fluted dish called a crespina,meaning rippled or wrinkled, on a form or mold to imitate the shape of contemporary metalwork. The young man in the center of this decorative dish is bound to a tree. As he is bound to the tree, so he is bound by love. In keeping with this theme, a narrow, twisted rope encircles the central scene. This allegory of love as a bittersweet force that holds its victims captive was popular in sixteenth-century Italy.
This receding composition shows an artist carefully combining landscape and figures and maintaining points of interest even in the distance. The unknown draftsman used hatching and cross-hatching to create form, shadow, and movement, showing his concern with arranging light and shadow. Through the sketchy, expressive pen work in the background, he achieved an effect of spontaneity. Scholars have tentatively identified the scene as the Hunt of Diana. The woman in profile at the lower left, wearing a wreath on her head and holding a bow, is probably Diana, and the nearly hidden figure with horns or antlers watching the nymphs bathing in the pool above her may be Actaeon. The awkward trimming of figures on both the right and the left indicates that the sheet was originally larger. On the verso, the two faintly drawn pairs of reclining male figures recall studies for the river gods that Michelangelo had intended to place at the base of a tomb in the Medici Chapel in Florence. The other lightly drawn study may be an antique Roman sarcophagus front.
Neptune, Roman god of the sea, stands astride a dolphin on a bed of waves, lunging forward with his trident into the viewer's space. His unruly hair and beard and the billowing drapery that winds around his muscled figure evoke the sense of a whipping wind over the ocean. The flattened planes with which the sculptor modeled the muscles on the chest, arms, and legs heighten the feel of strength in the figure's movements. His intense focus on an unseen object before him adds a menacing tone. This drama of physicality and motion is characteristic of the Baroque style. The tabletop bronze is a reduced variant of a marble fountain sculpture made by Gian Lorenzo Bernini around 1620 for the garden of the great collector and patron, Cardinal Montalto, in Rome. All of the four known versions in bronze include a long-bodied dolphin between Neptune's legs, replacing the figure of a triton who served as a supportive strut on the marble statue. Reductions in bronze are unusual in Roman sculpture of the time; the multiple reproductions of Neptune are probably due to the celebrity of its maker, who dominated Roman sculptural production in the seventeenth century.
Venus, the goddess of love, resplendent in a brilliant blue gown, looks down at a gold shield emblazoned with an image of Athena. Venus went to her husband Vulcan's forge and asked him to make arms for her son Aeneas. Here, the powerfully built Vulcan holds upright the shield intended for Aeneas, gestures to the armor at his feet, and looks up at his wife for her approval. In the lower left-hand corner are two Cyclopes who have made the armor under Vulcan's direction. Francesco Solimena made a series of mythological paintings for the Procurator Canale in Venice. This canvas and its pendant, Tithonus Dazzled by the Crowning of Aurora, may commemorate a marriage, as both pictures show gifts exchanged between goddesses and their husbands.
Born from the sea, the mythological goddess Venus sits upon a throne pulled by muscular men and surrounded by her entourage. Her son Cupid flies nearby and grasps a handful of coral from a plate held by an attendant. Perched above Venus, a woman holds a string of pearls, a typical adornment of the goddess. The pearls fall through her hair and down along her shoulder. The composition is arranged in a loose pyramidal shape with Venus at the apex. Sebastiano Ricci used an array of flesh tones to describe and model the playful, graceful figures, from the reddish-brown tanned skin of the athletic men to the light brownish-peach skin of the cherub blowing a conch shell in the lower right-hand corner and the even lighter flesh of the women. Venus's softly painted skin is a creamy white with touches of pink in her cheeks, chest, stomach, and knees; her flesh glows as if lit from within. Against the blue sky, streaks of pink paint describe wispy clouds and fading sunlight. With the Triumph of the Marine Venus, Ricci made a transition from a more classical Baroque style of dramatic gestures, bold colors, and serious subject matter to a more Rococo style of light, pastel colors, elegant, graceful figures, and decorative compositional elements.
His eyes turned heavenward, this boy holds branches of palm and laurel in the manner of a Christian martyr. The sag in his chubby cheeks and the deep circles beneath his eyes are the features of a dead child. Such details help identify the figure as Simon of Trent, a two-year-old whose body was discovered on Easter 1475 in Trent, Italy. His corpse, which bore evidence of torture, was soon rumored to perform miracles. The town�s Jewish population was wrongfully accused of ritual murder, inflaming anti-Semitism and inspiring a cult of worship to which this sculpture may have belonged.
A gracefully posed young woman gestures towards a portrait bust that stands in the center of a large pedestal. Two children attempt to clamber up the pedestal while a dog rests in the back on the base. Around the pedestal, the attributes of an architect--T-square, compass, globe, books, and drawings--are casually placed, composing a still life. While the bust may be a portrait of an unidentified architect, the other figures are allegorical. The dog is a traditional symbol of fidelity, while the two children are symbols of their potential for instruction, referring to the moral, ethical, and utopian roles given to architects in this period. Although the use of allegory recalls tomb monuments, the piece speaks in a celebratory mode, honoring the architect with the classicizing vocabulary of the bust form and an elevated base adorned with garlands and fretwork molding. Similarly, rather than suggesting a mournful tone, the figures' poses suggest familial intimacy, particularly the young woman's informal leaning posture and her arm around the back of the bust. The work was made in several pieces that were joined together before firing. Except for the woman's head, which is hollow, each of the figures is made of solid clay.
Along a winding dirt path, the blind Belisarius carries his young guide. The boy has been bitten by a snake, which remains coiled around his bleeding leg. With his right arm wrapped limply around Belisarius's neck and his eyes closed, the youth balances precariously between life and death. Belisarius's eyes are also closed, but guided by his stick he moves forward with determination and purpose. He rises heroically against the spectacular sunset, a monumental figure creating a powerful outline against the sky. But the flaring sunset also signals a chill night and the uncertainty of the path ahead. Belisarius was a popular Byzantine general of the Roman Empire whose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In 1767, a novel by Jean-Fran�ois Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for artists--including Jacques-Louis David (Fran�ois G�rard's teacher), Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Jean-Baptiste Stouf (whose sculpture Belisarius is also in the Museum's collection). For this painting, G�rard both drew and departed from Marmontel's retelling of Belisarius's life. The general's young companion is present in Marmontel's novel. But to stress the bravery and pathos of the subject, G�rard introduced the incapacitating snakebite. While Belisarius was typically depicted in the act of begging, G�rard shows him standing and erect, his muscular form in sharp contrast to his guide's weakening body. The prominent helmet hanging from Belisarius's belt emphasizes the general's heroic past and underscores the injustice of his fall from favor.
Smiling, singing figures gather around a balcony to play musical instruments, inviting the viewers below to join in the fun. The revelers' facial expressions and bright colorful clothes heighten the festive, carefree mood. A parrot and a dog, gazing down from their perches, round out the merry group. Possibly part of an allegory of Harmony, the painting may have originally been slightly wider and twice as long, containing a complete balustrade and more figures. The head of the man at the top is a modern addition. Gerrit van Honthorst painted this illusionistic ceiling, the earliest of its type made in the Netherlands in 1622, two years after his return from Italy, where he saw similar painted ceilings. Careful calculation of perspective allows the figures to burst plausibly through the flat plane of the painted panel.
A personification of Fortune bestows symbols of wealth, status, and power on dumb animals who neither need nor deserve them. Fortune is usually represented with a blindfold, but Salvator Rosa showed her fully aware of her favors. Similarly, the cornucopia is usually shown facing upward; by depicting it overturned, Rosa expressed reckless extravagance. The beasts, portrayed with stark realism, trample the attributes of art and learning, including books and a palette. Draped in the cardinal red of the Catholic Church, an ass shields an owl, the symbol for wisdom, from the light. Bitter over his exclusion from papal patronage, Rosa included personal references: a book bearing his monogram and a pig stepping on a rose, which alludes to his name. As a satire of Pope Alexander VII's nepotistic artistic patronage, this painting nearly sent Rosa to prison. After showing it privately in his studio, he flagrantly disregarded all advice and exhibited it publicly in the Pantheon in 1659. Allegory of Fortunearoused such a furor that only intervention by the pope's brother saved him.
According to Greek legend, Achilles fell in love with the Trojan princess Polyxena, the daughter of the king of Troy. He was offered her hand in marriage if he agreed to end the war between the Greeks and the Trojans. At Polyxena's request, Achilles came to make a sacrifice to Apollo, but he was ambushed by Paris, Polyxena's brother, as he knelt at the altar. Paris shot a fatal arrow into Achilles' heel, his one vulnerable spot. Before he died, Achilles vengefully proclaimed that the treacherous Polyxena be sacrificed at his tomb. Here Giovanni Battista Pittoni depicted the ghost of Achilles demanding that his bride be killed. Polyxena, wearing a white wedding gown, extends her arm toward the priest brandishing a knife and with great dignity steps forward toward the tomb. Around her, a throng of Greeks and Trojans watch with mixed emotions. Although a violent subject, Pittoni's elegant, richly garbed figures and elaborate antique architecture make an appealing picture of mythological martyrdom.
Two of Christ's followers, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, carry his body from the cross to the tomb. Mary, his mother, kneels and pulls her son's face close to hers for one last moment, while Mary Magdalene kneels tearfully at his feet in splendid brocaded robes. Death has transformed Christ's green-tinged, rigid body in horrific detail: his hands are clenched into agonized claws, bloody scars from his Crown of Thorns dot his forehead, and his wounds are graphically evident. The artist, a follower of Rogier van der Weyden, based this painting on Weyden's altarpiece, now in the Prado in Madrid. As Weyden did, this artist described faces, fabrics, and objects in great detail and arranged the figures as though in a frieze. The shallow space is further limited by the use of the gold-stippled background.
Two Arcadian shepherds with coarse features discover a tomb inscribed with the words Temporalis �ternitas,alluding to the brevity or frailty of human life. The subject, one that Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione had borrowed from Poussin a decade earlier, was meant to remind viewers that time brings oblivion even to the highest achievements of humankind. An assortment of objects lying on the ground at the left--statues, musical instruments, a seashell, books, and armor--symbolize human accomplishments that have begun to crumble into ruin.  Set against a blue sky with purplish-gray clouds, Castiglione evoked the mystery of an ancient lost civilization. The colors are rich and powerful, with bright reds and blues and a strong red-brown ground.
In a portrait commemorating his Grand Tour, the Englishman John Talbot, later first Earl Talbot, casually poses full-length before a Roman background. Legs crossed in a leisurely manner, the young Talbot leans on his left elbow and rests his right hand on the top of his walking stick. He wears a light gold waistcoat and breeches with a rose-pink velvet coat and white hose and holds a tricornered hat with gold braid. Around him are allusions to his interest in classical antiquity. The Ludovisi Mars statue on the left and the Medici Vase on the right stand for two of Rome's most popular and important works of art. The broken capital in the left foreground and the base of a column at the right refer to Rome's classical architectural heritage. Pompeo Batoni was known for his portraits of wealthy Grand Tourists during their stay in Rome. He frequently depicted them in the presence of antiquities in order to amplify their image as learned, cultivated, yet leisured aristocrats.
Achilles, dressed in women's clothing, holds a shield while admiring a sword. Based on ancient legend, Achilles' mother, knowing that her son would die if he fought in the Trojan War, disguised him as a woman and entrusted him to King Lycomedes' household, where he lived among the king's daughters. When war threatened, Ulysses and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch him, knowing they had to trick him into revealing himself. Cunningly, they deposited a heap of gifts before the women: jewelry, clothes, and other finery, but also a sword and shield. When it came time to select from the gifts, Achilles instinctively grasped the weapons, thus revealing his true identity. Pietro Paolini placed his figures in a dark, shallow space, dramatically lighting the figure of Achilles. Additional highlights illuminate the faces of the other figures and pick out the shiny jewelry and weapons. The youthful, smooth complexions of Achilles and the king's daughters contrast with the aged, wrinkled appearances of Lycomedes and his wife.
The ancient Roman hero Mucius Scaevola thrusts his hand into the open flames and holds it there as the man he tried to assassinate stands over him, observing along with two guards. The artist showed the dramatic climax of an ancient tale: the Etruscan ruler Lars Porsenna condemned Scaevola to be burned at the stake for attempting to murder him while he besieged the city of Rome. The Roman's bravery so impressed Porsenna, however, that he set Scaevola free. The design is crammed with fanciful details, all intended as a model for a stained-glass window, one of a series on Roman heroes and heroines. The background shows the towers of Rome, which resembles a walled Renaissance town more than an ancient, classical city, surrounded by medieval siege engines. A heavily ornamented arch supported by a pair of robust columns frames the scene. Profiles of a king and an emperor decorate the coffered arch, while other vaguely classical motifs fill the arch, the sides of the columns, and the frieze along the base. The shield at the bottom remains empty except for the Roman numeral xxiii, perhaps signifying the twenty-third window in the series. The rest of the space could have been filled with further inscriptions.
In Greek legend, Eos, or Aurora, the goddess of dawn, falls in love with the mortal Tithonus, son of King Laomedon of Troy. According to the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, Aurora prevailed on Jupiter to grant the young human immortality, though later realized that she failed to stipulate his eternal youth in this request. To her horror, as their love affair continues, the once beautiful Tithonus begins to show signs of age. Solimena illustrates a moment later in the narrative, where, preparing to leave for earth to bring about the dawn, Aurora sits on a cloud while an angel crowns her with a wreath of flowers. She looms dominantly over her aged lover, who shields his eyes from the goddess�s brightness. The goddess, pained by Tithonus� withering appearance and failing body, eventually decided to put him out of his misery and turned him into a grasshopper, to be reminded of him whenever she heard the insect�s song.This large canvas, as well as the Death of Messalina and Venus at the Forge of Vulcan, also in the Getty Museum�s collection, were probably parts of a larger ensemble made for the Procurator, or state attorney, of Venice, Gerolamo Canale. The series may commemorate a marriage, since the pictures of Venus and Aurora both illustrate exchanges between goddesses and their lovers, while the Death of Messalina warns of the dangers of infidelity.
In this depiction of Christ�s arduous journey to his own crucifixion, Domenichino situates Christ at the forefront of the composition, gazing sorrowfully out at the viewer. Christ�s oppression and the cruelty of his tormentors are emphasized by the crowded composition, in which the figures seem to bear down upon the heavy cross that pins Christ to the ground. A Roman soldier in armor and sandals leads the procession and gestures with a baton at Simon of Cyrene, who tries to assist the fallen Christ. Behind them, another soldier tugs sharply on the rope tied around the prisoner�s body and raises his right arm to whip his back. Shocked faces from the civilian throng that accompanied Christ to Calvary are visible between the soldier�s legs.Copper plates were popular as a painting support in seventeenth-century Italy. Domenichino�s teachers, Denys Calvaert and, later, the Carracci family, made considerable use of the material, as did his Emilian contemporaries, Guido Reni and Guercino. The smooth, non-absorbent surface of copper facilitated artists in achieving meticulous detail and highly-saturated color on a small scale, as illustrated in this composition.
At the center of this lush pleasure scene lounges Omphale, queen of Lydia, an ancient country bordering on the Aegean. After she bought Hercules, wearing his lion's pelt at the left, as a slave and her lover, he served her for three years, ridding the land of robbers and other pests and fathering at least three of her sons.In Luigi Garzi's mythological picture, ancient architecture mingles with contemporary clothing of the early 1700s. Despite the splendor of the architecture, Garzi achieved an intimate effect, partly through the many anecdotal elements: women lean in over the wall, a child plays with a tiny dog, and putti frolic to the music of Hercules's tambourine. Garzi successfully combined these light-hearted elements, typical of the Rococo, with High Baroque's physicality and grandness of gesture.
A woman, her thin hair tightly wrapped in a white scarf, looks out at the viewer with teary eyes and a toothless smile. The urban poor of Rome and the peasants of the neighboring countryside inspired Michael Sweerts during his stay in Italy in the mid-1600s. The practice of painting the lower classes was relatively new at the time, and pictures of the poor were often derisive caricatures. Sweerts, however, treated his subject with compassion, vividly capturing the woman's inner beauty while accurately recording her external appearance: the loose skin, thinning hair, and wart on the left side of her face. Although the painting is highly finished, Sweerts's rich brushwork is evident in alternately blended and separated strokes of different shades, creating a strong sense of three-dimensional form. This brushwork is especially striking in the head scarf and the collar.
In the classic biblical tale of faith, daring, and skill overcoming brute strength and superior odds (1 Samuel 17), the shepherd boy David slew the armored Philistine giant Goliath with just a stave, a slingshot, and a pouch containing a few pebbles from a local brook. After stunning Goliath with a stone from his slingshot, David quickly took up the giant's sword and severed his head.Assured that his audience knew the story, Salomon de Bray could evoke a meaningful narrative by depicting only a boy with an oversize sword. De Bray's David embodies youth and naivet�; he is an ordinary, rather blank-faced Dutch youth, not an idealized heroic type.David with His Sword shares the same size, medium, and composition with the artist's Bust of Samson; they were probably paired as pendants or as part of a series of Old Testament heroes.
Better known for his landscapes and religious scenes, here Bassano paints a portrait of a sitter whose identity is not known. A melancholy, middle-aged man with a florid complexion, a long beard, and large, watery eyes looks to one side, his gaze attentive and seemingly intrigued. Diffused light gracefully illuminates the sitter�s distinctive features, while his delicate pink flesh tones are offset against the minimalist green background. His head inclines to the right as though he is listening to or observing someone outside the picture frame, his mouth partly open, as if ready to speak. The unknown man's slightly protuberant eyes communicate an emotional state that provokes a sympathetic response from the viewer. Jacopo Bassano emphasized the man's strong, physical presence by the darkened shadow cast against the wall on the left.Bassano�s biographer, Carlo Ridolfi, wrote of the artist�s ability in the genre of portraiture, though relatively few of his portraits have survived. Ridolfi wrote that Bassano was �valued for his portraits�, which were �naturalistically rendered� thanks to the artist�s abilities when working from life.
Standing before a wooded landscape, an unknown woman looks out at the viewer while plucking a sprig from a fruit tree. Her pale violet silk dress that shimmers where it catches the light, her elaborately styled hair, and the pearls adorning her hair, ears, and neck identify her as a woman of status.Jan Mytens specialized in portraiture in The Hague, Netherlands, where he enjoyed the patronage of the members of the highest level of society, including the royal court. As in this painting, he often depicted his elegant sitters in half-length standing before idyllic landscapes.
When the Persian princess Granida met the shepherd Daifilo and the shepherdess Dorilea resting in the woods, Daifilo fell in love with Granida at first sight. Oddly enough, Granida does not appear in this painting; she may have appeared at the left and was cut from the painting subsequently, or she may have appeared in a pendant painting.All of Utrecht's leading artists painted scenes from the popular Dutch pastoral play Granida, written in about 1605. Hendrick Ter Brugghen here employed his characteristic low viewpoint, monumental figures, pale pastel color scheme, pinkish-red noses, and smooth surfaces. Responding to Caravaggio's influence, the artist presented the scene up close, dramatically illuminated by a broad beam of light from the left. But instead of Caravaggio's dark tones, he used delicate colors typical of his teacher Abraham Bloemaert's palette.
An inscription in the upper right corner identifies the elegant young woman seen in three-quarter view as Barbara Kressin, aged seventeen, and the date of the likeness as 1544.Barbara�s sober and subtly ornamented black gown serves as a magnificent foil for accoutrements which convey her wealth and social standing: the embroidered collar, blackwork cuffs, heavy gold chain, and the long gold girdle around her waist. The soft leather gloves she gently clasps, decorated with flowers may, along with the rings on her forefinger and the girdle, refer to her marriage. While Barbara Kressin has been associated with the Nuremberg family of the same name, her identity cannot be confirmed. The naturalism of the sitter�s face and hands, together with the close attention to the details of costume, suggest the as-yet unidentified artist hails from the Netherlands.
Like a variation upon a theme, these two terracotta busts subtly contrast with each other: one woman looks up, the other down, one turns to the right, the other to the left, but neither woman meets the viewer's eyes. Sculptor Augustin Pajou modeled the busts with a striking simplicity. Their faces are modeled in smooth planes, and their hair, loosely tied with a ribbon, is indicated by thinly marked grooves. Pajou was paid 240 livres for these busts, which were designed as models for gilt wood console ornaments on a balcony for the Salle de l'Op�ra at the royal palace at Versailles. This elaborate theater was being newly renovated in preparation for the wedding of Marie-Antoinette and the Dauphin. The finished wood heads are now lost; they were probably destroyed in a subsequent renovation of the room.
Bathsheba stares brazenly out at the viewer while a maidservant trims her toenails. King David, who saw her beauty and desired her, sent her a summons to appear at his palace. Although she was married, Bathsheba was forced to comply. A popular subject, artists often portrayed Bathsheba as distraught about her dilemma. Here, Jan Steen depicted her as a temptress, rather than the innocent victim of the king's passion. In this moralizing painting, Steen commented on the foolishness of human behavior. Bathsheba's robe is casually arranged to reveal her breast and bare legs. The shoe in the right foreground symbolizes lasciviousness; the fountain on the left probably alludes to female fecundity. She is so lost in her thoughts that she holds King David's note loosely in her right hand and pays no attention to the small dog or to the old woman grasping her shoulder.
In this allegory of the status of the artist and the nature of his profession, a male artist instructs two pupils: a young boy and a fashionably dressed young woman. A plaster cast of a sculpture of a nude male seems to be the object of the day's exercise in how to draw, but the studio is filled with many other props and materials. On the table are pens, brushes, charcoal pencils, and a woodcut depicting the head of an old man. Several plaster casts hang from a shelf that supports a sculpture of an ox, the symbol of Saint Luke, the patron saint of painters. A plaster putto is suspended from the ceiling in front of a tapestry, which is draped to reveal an easel with a painting and a violin hung on the wall. In the foreground a stretched canvas leans on a chest heaped with a bound album and a carpet. Objects related to the traditional theme of vanitas (vanity), a frequent subject of Dutch still lifes, are piled in the lower right corner. These items--a laurel wreath, a skull, wine, a fur muff, a book, a lute, and a pipe--remind viewers of the brevity of life and fame.
Leaning on a fabric-covered table and resting her head in her hand, this young woman looks out with an enigmatic expression. Since the Renaissance, artists have used this pose to portray melancholy. The pose, combined with her hauntingly unreadable face, gives a human poignancy and psychological tension to the figure.Juxtaposing bold, individual strokes of color, Paul C�zanne built up the woman's powerful physical presence and the space she occupies. As a twentieth-century painter and admirer of C�zanne observed, his later works, such as Young Italian Woman, have "an enormous sense of volume, breathing, pulsating, expanding, contracting, through his use of colors." While the woman's form is convincing, the space behind and around her can appear contradictory and even confusing. How far away is the wall? Is the tabletop flat underneath the cloth? Does she sit or stand? These questions give tension and movement to an otherwise stable composition.From the 1890s until the end of his life, C�zanne painted a number of these grand figure studies, usually relying upon local workers or residents for his models.
John Peyto-Verney, fourteenth Lord Willoughby de Broke, and his wife, Lady Louisa North, appear about to take tea with their three young children. She holds her daughter, who stands on the table attempting a first step. In high spirits, one son enters on the right pulling a bright red toy horse. Another son attempts to take a piece of buttered bread from the table while receiving an admonishing gesture from his father. Johann Zoffany, with his ability to portray lively figures interacting together in meticulous detailed settings, excelled at conversation pieces. These informal group portraits, introduced as a new genre of painting in England in the 1700s, vividly recorded the settings and social customs of the time.  Zoffany took care to include the details of the gentry's lives: Lady Louisa's shimmering light blue gown, the landscape painting above the fireplace mantel, the fine porcelain tea service, and the reflections on the highly polished silver urn. The sparse room also makes a statement about the family's social position. Only an ancient, titled family of the British ruling class would adopt the deliberate casualness of the olive-drab walls and worn carpet. The family has nonetheless displayed its wealth in their fashionable costumes.
Observed by his symbol, the eagle, and poised to write God's words, Saint John looks up for divine inspiration, which he receives as brilliant light. Saint John, the Galilean fisherman who became one of Christ's apostles, is traditionally considered the author of the Gospel according to John and of the Bible's Book of Revelation. Hals used only light and handling of paint to create the lifelike, fleeting quality that made his portraits so prized. He chose a dramatic moment, then captured it with bold, spontaneous brushwork. A contemporary reported that Hals called the final touches he made to his canvases "putting in his handwriting"--adding the trademark highlights that give his pictures much of their sparkle. Treasured by both artists and royalty, Saint Johnwas owned by painter Gerard Hoet and later by Catherine the Great of Russia.
The name of this vase, cuvette Mahon, refers to the British-occupied port of Mah�n on the island of Minorca, which was captured by the French in 1756 at the beginning of the Seven Years' War. In addition to the cuvette Mahon, this French victory spawned other objects named after the town, including a sauce � la Mahonnaise, now known as mayonnaise. The blue and gold decoration in three different patterns--trellis, pointill�, and vermicul�--over a pink ground is an unusual combination, very rarely seen on S�vres porcelain. Jean-Louis Morin, who painted the farmyard scene, copied it from an engraving after a painting by the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger.
With an approach completely different from that of his contemporaries, Jacobus Vrel captured the feeling of everyday life on a town street where tall buildings with shops and markets crowd out the sky and people have time to chat amid the bricks and cobblestones.  Never trained in the popular manner, Vrel did not use perspective and he never primed his canvases. His figures do not cast shadows. Yet his primitive, independent style imparts a naive intimacy and truth to the moments he chose for his panels. His humble approach, imbued with sincerity and compassion for the average person, shows sensitivity toward the quiet moments that make up the bulk of most people's lives.  This picture was once owned by Etienne-Joseph-Th�ophile-Thor� [pseud. Willem B�rger], who rediscovered Johannes Vermeer in the 1800s and believed that this panel was by Vermeer himself.
Lurking in the shadows, grotesque monsters emerge to taunt Saint Anthony, attempting to impede his meditation. Grinning with satanic delight, the demons take human and raptor-like animal forms. Unperturbed, Saint Anthony continues to read his meditations. Divine light illuminates his figure, forming a bright halo around his head. He is identified by his three principle attributes: a tau cross (T), the pig behind him, and the crutch at his side. The tau, a symbol of immortality in ancient Egypt, was adopted by Alexandrian Christians and became known as the Egyptian cross.  Anthony was born in Egypt in 251 AD. After his parents' death, he distributed his property among the poor and retired to the Egyptian desert to contemplate God in solitude. He remained there for fifteen years, during which time he began his legendary combat against the devil, withstanding a series of temptations, which according to Anthony's biographer, Saint Athanasius, took the form of demonic apparitions and erotic visions. Orsi shows the venerable saint, serene and resolute in his devotions, as an exemplum for all Christians in their meditations. Having successfully resisted evil, Saint Anthony emerged from the desert to instruct a group of hermits who sought to imitate his example. Thus he became the father of Christian monasticism, for which he is called Saint Anthony the Great or Saint Anthony Abbot.  Lelio Orsi depicted this struggle between good and evil vividly using strong chiaroscuro (starkly contrasting light and shadow), and by rendering the grotesque features of the demons in loose, painterly brushstrokes, emphasizing their lack of humanity.
In the upper half of this oil study, Christ is depicted in glory surrounded by adoring angels. Looking up at him are four martyr saints: Saints Celsus, Marcionilla, Julian, and Basilissa. Pompeo Batoni made this sketch when he was only twenty-eight, in preparation for his first important commission in Rome. He was commissioned to create a life-size altarpiece that still hangs in the the church of Saints Celsus and Julian today.
Using only pen and ink, Lorenzo Costa portrayed the cradle of Christian monasticism, the Thebaid, a Roman division of the upper Nile River valley. Beginning with Saint Paul of Thebes and Saint Anthony of Egypt in the 200s, Christian monks retreated to this region, to live a solitary life of ascetism and prayer. Over time, these monks, also known as "desert fathers," organized into communities. Costa's scratchy, energetic draftmanship created a bustling composition filled with monks and a landscape riddled with the grottoes, huts, and caves they used for prayer and shelter. He portrayed an imaginary scene, incorporating a variety of monastic saints and spanning different periods. In the upper left background, Saints Paul and Anthony are shown seated, receiving bread from a raven through which God provided nourishment. Mary Magdalene, who supposedly lived her later years alone in the desert, stands near the river to the right. The landscape itself appears more European than Egyptian, perhaps reflecting Costa's native countryside around Bologna, Italy, rather than the real Thebaid.
Head of a Young Boy Crowned with Laurel is a magnificent example of Lorenzo di Credi�s appealing draftsmanship. The drawing is a highly finished cartoon (a study for design transfer) for the head of a prominent youthful shepherd in Credi�s Adoration of the Shepherds (Uffizi, Florence). One of the largest and most important works of his career, the altarpiece was commissioned by the Florentine wool merchant Jacopo Bongianni for a chapel in the church of Santa Chiara, Florence, and likely dates between 1500 and 1505.     The artist used the black chalk with extreme subtlety to model the features and show the delicate fall of light on the face, and it is easy to forget that chalk draftsmanship was in its infancy at this time, having become common only twenty years before. With a delicate technique very similar to that of his studio colleagues Verrocchio and Leonardo da Vinci, Lorenzo di Credi particularly used black chalk for head studies. The current sheet has pinpricked holes along many of the lines to transfer the design to the panel, but there is no sign that chalk dust was knocked through these holes, as would have been the practice. Instead, it seems that the artist�understandably�wished to preserve this beautiful sheet and used the pricking to create an intermediary working cartoon (most cartoons were ruined in the process of transferring the design to the panel).    As was common practice, this drawing was quite possibly used by the artist on a second occasion, since laurel leaves (which are not pricked) were added around the head, perhaps for a figure of Apollo, although no painting by Credi with such a figure survives today.
Facing leftward, Magdaleine Pinceloup de la Grange gazes into the distance. Her refined dress is accented by flowers, ribbons, and pearls. But Magdaleine does not appear quite as at ease as her husband, Charles-Fran�ois, in a companion portrait. She sits straight upright, her back parallel to, but not quite touching, the chair behind her. With both hands, Magdaleine grasps a large gray-blue cat that bemusedly engages the viewer. Because of its large size and distinctive coloration, the cat can be identified as a chartreux, one of the oldest and most cherished French breeds. Jean-Baptiste Perronneau included feline companions in several of his portraits of female subjects, reinforcing the elegance and sophistication of his sitters. Here, the bells on the chartreux's collar echo the pearls around Magdaleine's neck, suggesting that cat and sitter alike are refined objects for visual delectation.

In this ambitious composition, fifty figures occupy themselves in activities ranging from the pure frivolity of dancing to the tenderness of a caress shared by mother and child. Inspired by Jean-Antoine Watteau's f�tes galantes, in which elegant people engage in a variety of diversions, often in an idealized park or garden setting, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin devised a similar rural subject. During the 1700s, country dances had become a popular form of summer entertainment for Parisian society. A tireless chronicler of his time, Saint-Aubin surely would have viewed these dances and theatrical performances on the outskirts of Paris. Drawing on the wit and meticulous observation seen in Dutch paintings of peasants in the 1500s and 1600s, Saint-Aubin refined the rustic folk in a characteristically French Rococo treatment.
An unknown artist painted the center of this large display plate with a scene of the lovers Hero and Leander, who lived on opposite sides of the strait separating Asia and Europe. According to this myth, every night Leander swam to visit his beloved in her tower. When Leander was drowned in a storm, Hero threw herself into the sea in despair and also drowned. Leander is painted three times on this plate, so that his story unfolds in a continuous narrative. The tower from which Hero watches Leander's approach rises awkwardly from the sea; its lower half is visible beneath the painted water. The artist miscalculated the composition and had to paint over part of the tower in order to widen the patch of water enough to show Leander both drowned and swimming. This interesting mistake results from the artist's unwillingness to completely wash off the entire scene and start again, which would have been the only way to make imperceptible changes after having applied pigments and glaze.

Carlo Dolci painted this as part of a series depicting the Four Evangelists. Matthew is depicted transcribing the opening words of his Gospel, which are accurately reproduced in Hebrew, the saint's native language. With characteristically detailed brushwork, Dolci meticulously describes the textures of the saint's wispy beard, the heavy softness of his robe, even the dirt under his fingernails.  The artist�s refined, polished canvases appealed to seventeenth-century patrons, particularly in his native Florence. This series was painted for one of his confessors (probably Domenico Carpanti) and sold to him, according to a contemporary account, for the meagre price of five scudi a piece, scarcely enough to cover the cost of the artist�s materials. Such a gesture reflects the affection felt by the pious artist for his confessor, as well as his need to establish a reputation for himself at this early stage of his career.
Standing on the right, a kidnapper firmly grasps the arm of a young girl while an armored knight tries to hand over precious jewels. In this theatrical painting, John Everett Millais depicted a sixteenth-century scene of a father paying ransom for his two daughters.  The subject matter and technique are typical of the Pre-Raphaelite movement founded by Millais. Although he wanted to express a moral seriousness in his work, the drama is unconvincing: the figures are stiff and too large for the room they inhabit. The Ransom received criticism of this kind when it was exhibited, but no one could find fault with Millais's painting technique. The sharp, near-photographic rendering of objects, materials, and individuals display Millais's technical brilliance.  To produce this painting, Millais enlisted the help of those around him. His mother made and designed the costumes. His friend Mr. Miller posed for the head of the knight, while a railway guard named "Strong" was the model for the knight's body. The girls were painted from one model, Miss Helen Petrie, and Major McBean posed as one of the kidnappers. Apparently not pleased with the end result, Millais later referred to this painting as "the picture with the dreadful blue-and-white page in the corner."
Two milliners sit at a dramatically angled worktable, their bodies partly obscured by the shadowed hat stands that crowd their work space. Seen as little more than a silhouette, the figure at right works carefully on a hat. Her attentiveness is not shared by her older counterpart who, though grasping a swath of pink fabric, appears lost in thought, gazing beyond the frame with a disquieting expression. The brightly colored ribbons--pink, yellow, orange, and green--draw attention to the drabness of the room and its inhabitants. Over the course of about thirty years, Edgar Degas produced more than twenty paintings, pastels, and drawings of millinery shops. Among modern painters, Degas alone depicted this subject matter with such frequency. His voyeuristic yet empathetic portrait of the milliner's private world focuses on the physical hardship of their work. The woman at the left embodies the painter's concern; even at rest, her wiry body and pallid skin registers a life of hard work and meager reward.
Precious objects of this type were recorded in inventories of church treasuries and collectors cabinets. These rooms or series of rooms held unusual or intricate arrangements of rocks, shells, ivory, clocks, or microscopes, displaying the wonders of nature and science. Scholars and wealthy patrons collected intricate objects such as this carving to display in their collections and for private devotion. An unknown sculptor carved this extraordinary work from a single mass of chalcedony, a type of quartz favored by gem engravers. The folds of the Madonna's cloak form a fluid frame that surrounds and encloses the Christ child, angel, and orb against her breast. The sculptor used the red matrix of the chalcedony mass to highlight specific parts of the image, such as the cross, the angel's wing, the gospels, and the edge of the cloth.
Solimena here represents the murder of Messalina, third wife of the Roman Emperor Claudius, who had a reputation for promiscuity. Though the emperor forgave Messalina�s adultery, others saw this as a weakness, and a Roman officer ordered her assassination. The dynamic composition illustrates the moment in which a soldier thrusts a sword toward the frightened empress, who grasps his arm in a helpless attempt to fend off the attack.This may be the only painted representation of the death of Messalina, a story from the Annals of Tacitus. The subject provided Solimena with an opportunity to engage with a dramatic narrative, whose intensity he heightened by illuminating the figures in the darkness with stark, white light and painting them on a monumental scale. According to his eighteenth-century biographer, Bernardo de' Dominici (1683�1759), Solimena painted this subject for a series of five canvases of historical and mythological subjects for the Procurator Canale in Venice.
A young woman turns her head to look over her left shoulder, staring out with dark, almond shaped eyes. She wears a high-necked dress with an embroidered collar that opens at her throat, revealing a narrow necklace or clasp. A schuffa, or headdress made of braided hair held in place by a brooch in the center, decorates her head. Although her identity is unknown, the format of the portrait and her clothing indicate the sitter was from northern Italy. The artist sketched her in chalk in the early 1500s in preparation for a formal painting. Scholars are uncertain about the meaning of the chalk lines in the bottom left corner. They may signal an abandoned attempt at drawing one of the sitter's hands or the upper sleeve of her drapery.
These marble portrait busts were not intended as a pendant pair, but when displayed together they reveal a family resemblance--these are sisters. The elder, Brigitte Garnier d'Isle, alert and dignified, turns to her left with a far-off gaze. The younger Ad�la�de very much resembles her elder sister, but her gaze is more immediate, her face more exuberant and her pursed lips seem to barely suppress a grin. Each sister displays a fashionable hairstyle, composed of tight waves of hair, and wears a loose shawl. Ad�la�de's slightly more revealing drapery is knotted at her breast, reflecting her relative informality. Brigitte and Ad�la�de were the daughters of the architect Jean-Charles Garnier d'Isle, who shared a personal and professional relation with the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. Garnier d'Isle designed the ch�teau and gardens of the lavish Bellevue estate of Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV. Probably on the recommendation of Garnier d'Isle, Pigalle was commissioned to create garden statues at Bellevue. Garnier d'Isle clearly admired Pigalle's intimate and unembellished portrait style. He himself sat for a portrait that Pigalle exhibited, as a plaster bust, at the Salon of 1750.
Representing a profile bust of Louis XIV, this is a leather copy of a marble relief by the French sculptor Fran�ois Girardon (1628-1715). Set in an elaborately tooled leather frame, it was made using the repouss� technique, in which the image was pressed or hammered into the leather from the reverse side. Such royal portraits were not generally made specifically for the king, but more broadly for courtiers and officials to display their loyalty to the monarch.
A beautiful courtly woman is shown next to the arms of the Eberler family of Basel, Switzerland. She wears a richly patterned blue gown with short slit sleeves, long kid gloves, a dagger attached to a gold belt, a gold necklace, and an elaborate headdress with a trailing white veil. The coat of arms comprise a shield with the charge (heraldic motif) of a red boar�s head on a patterned gold field (ground), helmet, crest (distinctive feature above a helmet) of a red boar�s head, and mantling (cloak-like decoration behind a coat of arms) in the form of wide densely curled leaves of the colors (both red and gold). The figure and armorial are set against a red damask-patterned ground within an arbored arch with birds in the supports and a lively image of falconry above. The panel is worked to the highest refinement, both in the sophisticated application of the vitreous paint and silver stain, and in the use of flashed glass. The motifs and style bear close comparison to the work of the Basel glass painter, Lucas Zeiner, as well as to the earliest work of the great Swiss Renaissance master, Niklaus Manuel Deutsch.
The crucified Christ is shown between the Virgin and Saint John, all set before a panoramic landscape of hills and distant towns. The Crucifixion roundel is surrounded by a wide floral border, making the serious and familiar iconic subject part of a brightly decorative ensemble.
The panel shows a seraph (angel of high rank usually shown with multiple wings). It was probably one in a series of similar images forming part of the decorative scheme of a large window. Facing forward with outstretched arms, the figure has a red halo flanked by blue leaf-like fronds and wears a distinctive white cloth tied around the neck. A pair of white and yellow wings spread out from the shoulders and a pair of blue wings fold over the chest. The large eyes, wide face, and broadly painted details of the wings and garment suggest that the image was meant to be read clearly from a distance.
To create a living art, that is my aim. --Gustave Courbet Through a dynamic composition and radical painting technique, Gustave Courbet emphasized the specific qualities of this primordial cave in his native region of the Jura Mountains in eastern France. Earthy hues and textures swirl around a tunnel-like entrance, drawing attention to the clear blue stream running through it. Two large boulders stand before the vortex, several feet from a wall hugged by delicate scaffolding. To mimic the cavern's craggy and colorful surfaces, Courbet used palette knives to apply and scrape off paint and brushes to mix drying paint in with wet. Like many tourists and scientists of his day, Courbet was probably drawn to the grotto for its geological interest. In the mid-1860s, he frequently painted caves as a means to explore composition and technique freely, and to demonstrate his strong belief that artistic subjects should be rooted in one's lived experience. He saw the basis of Realism as "the denial of the ideal," the rejection of established classical subjects and a refined style. He chose instead, to paint only what he could see.
Nearly nine feet tall, this larger-than-life, extremely slender figure towers over the viewer. Despite her emaciated frame, she commands the surrounding space. Her rail-thin arms appear almost fused to her torso, heightening a palpable sense of empty space around the figure. The relatively large base emphasizes her fragility. The deeply kneaded, distressed bronze surface suggests a morbid, decomposing form.  Alberto Giacometti began creating isolated, skeletal female and male figures in the wake of World War II. At first working on a small scale, he soon began to produce much taller forms like this one. Giacometti conceived this sculpture during the last decade of his life. It was originally intended as one of four female figures that would occupy the Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York City. Committed to the idea that art and everyday life should be seamlessly integrated, Giacometti imagined a public stage for his bronze figures where people using the plaza could interact freely with them.  Because of Giacometti's dislike for long-distance travel, a model of the plaza was sent to him in Paris. The group of rough, eroded, heavily worked figures was first modeled in plaster and then cast in bronze, but it was never sent to New York. Unsatisfied by the relationship between the sculpture and the site--which he had never visited--Giacometti finally decided to abandon the project, and the figures were sold separately.
With every part of its body alert and stretched-out, this powerful horse looks ready to break into a gallop. Its rider, a diminutive male figure, does not share the horse's forward gaze, but instead looks upward with an expression of joyfulness. This state of ecstasy is underscored by the rider's outstretched arms and legs. Together, rider and mount form a cross-shaped mass of smooth surfaces and compact strength. The Classical theme of the horseback rider was a subject Marino Marini pursued throughout his career. These forms were not intended to represent a specific subject, but to operate as metaphors or symbols. Marini's approach varied greatly over time. His equestrian forms from the late 1930s are stoic and calm. Ten years later, in the wake of World War II, his riders are often maimed; their mounts, violent and out of control. As Marini developed the series, the forms also became more abstract, angular, and severe. This sculpture lies somewhere between the heroic and the tragic: an ecstatic rider perhaps representing an initial optimism in the wake of the Allied victory in World War II.
The history of the world in Christian terms is often portrayed as a conflict between good and evil. That struggle is played out in this small but elaborate sculpture of the archangel Michael battling followers of the Devil. A youthful Saint Michael raises his sword triumphantly while standing atop a pile of writhing demons. A half-sphere forming the sculpture's base provides a striking physical context for this cosmic battle. Shapes of continents subtly painted on its surface, and flames issuing from cracks, symbolize a corrupt earth beneath a war-ravaged heaven.  The story that this sculpture illustrates comes from a passage in the Bible's prophetic last section, The Book of Revelation (12:7-9): "And there was a war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ... and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceived the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."  Depictions of Saint Michael striking a dragon, serpent, or semi-human figure first became popular in European art during the Middle Ages, and over time came to symbolize various contemporary concerns. The imagery could serve as an explanation for the origin of sin, symbolize a church struggling against dissidence (such as during the Counter-Reformation), or remind viewers of spiritual remedies to the plague and other earthly scourges.  When first discovered, the sculpture called to mind late seventeenth-century works by artists in Naples, particularly those by sculptor Lorenzo Vaccaro and his circle. However, striking differences in medium and carving style have led scholars to believe it was made by a South German or Austrian artist influenced by Neapolitan art. The medium from which it is made --Solnhofen limestone--is only quarried in the Bavarian Alps. This soft stone enabled the sculptor to carve against the grain and create highly three-dimensional elements, including the angel's skirt and headdress.
God the Father sits enthroned, holding the crucified Christ with the Holy Spirit between them, all three dominating the composition. Together they represent the Trinity, the central doctrine of the Christian faith, in which all three are united as one. This recently discovered altarpiece was carefully designed for the kneeling donor, a cleric, and expresses his desire for penance. The donor's plea for salvation inscribed on the scroll cleverly incorporates the date "1479" in Roman numerals. Saint Stephen stands protectively over him, bearing the stones of martyrdom on his head.
In this painting, Nicolaes Maes almost exactly copied Albrecht D�rer's 1504 engraving of the Nativity. Maes simply widened the house to the left, provided new poses for the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus, and added the four shepherds that give the painting its new subject. The harmony of blacks, browns, and whites that he chose emphasizes the painting's print origin. He successfully used the fluid medium of oil paint to render such textures as the stable's wooden door, the exposed bricks, and the thatched roof.
The Vexed Man is one of a series of sixty-nine portrait busts or "character heads" made by Franz Xaver Messerschmidt, an eighteenth-century German sculptor active in Austria. Messerschmidt sculpted them during the last thirteen years of his life, while apparently suffering from mental illness.  This bust portrays a middle-aged man with a sour expression, which seems to fall somewhere between a grimace and a scowl. The most telling aspect may be the furrowed brow above squinting eyes and a scrunched nose. But natural cracks in the bust's alabaster surface seem to echo the topography of his skin, both softened by age yet hardened by the extreme expression. The man's receding hairline, wrinkles, and sagging jawline contrast with tensed cheek and neck muscles. Although the character seems to express irritation and annoyance, it is not certain whether Messerschmidt intended that interpretation, because he did not give the bust a title.  This bust and the series to which it belongs reflect the intellectual concerns of artists and scholars during the Enlightenment era, when a surge of interest in the sciences occurred. Studies in physiognomy were highly popular at the time. Perhaps as influential was Messerschmidt's undiagnosed mental condition, which could have been schizophrenia. A contemporary wrote that Messerschmidt told him that by making the character heads, he hoped to ward away spirits that invaded his mind.
Through exacting realism, Jean-Antoine Houdon convincingly captured the skin's texture, and the underlying bone and musculature of this eminent figure. The sitter's attire and hair--styled with a long ponytail at the back--indicate his status as a high-ranking French government official. But Monsieur de Bir�'s personality also shows through in the bust's subtle features. The wrinkles around his eyes and the soft jowls that brush his scarf reveal advanced age. Yet his sparkling eyes and the upturned corners of his lips, which hint at a smile, convey a warm disposition. To accurately render Bir�'s likeness, Houdon measured his head and face with calipers, and probably made a plaster "life mask" for reference. He probably modeled the bust first in clay, and then made a plaster cast. From those initial studies, Houdon would have produced this final marble version, which he gave to the sitter. Bir� may have commissioned the bust to celebrate his newly appointed position as a treasury official under Louis XVI.
This panel showing the Virgin Mary and the Christ child was made for the abbey of Klosterneuberg, an important religious site outside Vienna. It was in the apex of a tall cloister window that had scenes from the life of Christ in the lower panels. These windows were by the Master of Klosterneuberg, one of the most accomplished glass painters of the Middle Ages. In this example the artist achieved a sophisticated tenderness and delicacy in representing the subject � the two figures look into each other�s eyes as the child lightly touches his mother�s chin. The dark piece representing the arm of the Virgin may be a palimpsest (replacement painted on old glass).
In seventeenth-century Flanders, paintings of peasant scenes began to take on a new character, emphasizing carousing, drinking, and smoking. The central action of this painting is a variation on the theme of cardsharks made popular by Caravaggio. Josse van Craesbeeck's Card Players also shows the influence of his friend and teacher Adriaen Brouwer, who painted similarly sordid tavern scenes.  Craesbeeck presented peasants engaged in crude, dishonest, and vulgar activities. In this disreputable game of cards, the woman decides which card to play by examining her opponent's cards, which she sees in a mirror held up behind her opponent's back by her accomplice. At the right, another woman with a broken pipe at her feet drinks wine and smokes, while a man relieves himself against the wall. A seated child wearing a kind of turban plays on the floor. The woman with the straw hat and the bearded man, colored with great refinement, are characteristic types in Craesbeeck's repertory of figures. Possibly influenced by Caravaggio's followers, Craesbeeck paid careful attention to the effects of light, which streams into the room from a single window.
After curing Tobit's blindness, returning the family's wealth, and making it possible for Tobit's son Tobias to marry his beloved Sarah, the Archangel Raphael has dropped his disguise and revealed himself as an angel, saying, "I was not acting on my own will, but by the will of God." Such a scene of miraculous intervention was especially attractive to Protestants in Holland, who believed in doctrines of faith, mercy, and divine grace.  Jan Victors took his subject from the Book of Tobit, among the Apocrypha in the Old Testament. Borrowing elements from his teacher Rembrandt van Rijn's 1637 rendition of the subject, Victors set his figures before and within an architectural setting and opened the composition to a clouded landscape on one side. Strong contrasts of light and dark and a foreshortened angel, flying away on a diagonal and viewed from the back, give the scene animation and urgency. Victors's characteristically careful interpretation of surface details includes beautifully rendered highlights on the costumes and Tobias's head.
In this gentle allegory of peace by Louis Jean Fran�ois Lagren�e, Mars, the Roman god of War, throws back the rich green bed curtains that frame the scene. As the drapery parts, the morning light spills in to reveal the form of the sleeping Venus, the Roman goddess of love. Mars gazes at her, utterly captivated by her beauty. Her love has tempered his fierce character, and his shield and sword lie abandoned on the floor. Echoing the lovers' bliss, a pair of white doves, symbolizing Peace, build a nest in Mars's helmet. Lagren�e created his finest works, including this small, jewel-like painting, around 1770. The lavish folds of drapery, the delicate play of light over fabric and skin, and the rich, restrained palette combine to create a captivatingly beautiful image.
This figure probably once formed part of a series of figures of various street vendors. He holds out an apron displaying a fish, grapes, a slice of melon, and two cucumbers. After buying fish, fruits, or vegetables at market, these vendors walked through the streets of the towns, advertising their wares with shouts or songs. The modeler at the Mennecy porcelain manufactory may have copied this figure from one of many engraved series of "Cries of Paris" depicting such hawkers. There were so many hawkers, forming a potentially powerful group, that the king allowed them special privileges, including free entry to certain theatrical performances. This idealized view of a peasant with his sturdy clogs, short jacket, and apron appealed to wealthy patrons, who ordered large numbers of these figures. Designers created such small sculptures to be seen from all sides as table decorations.
In a barn, a young maid squats while milking a brown and white spotted cow. Standing nearby, another cow seems to be waiting its turn. Gerard ter Borch treated the routine chore of milking in a straightforward manner, rejecting the humorous themes often favored by seventeenth-century Dutch genre painters. He was especially skilled at rendering the textures and surfaces of objects like those found in the foreground: the roughly hewn stool, the wooden basin filled with water, the chipped ceramic crock, and the shiny metal hinges of the buckets. The painting's muted colors and subtle play of light are characteristic of Ter Borch's work.
A young man with a handsome profile and perfectly coiffed hair stares determinedly out of the panel. He may be a Hungarian poet, Janus Pannonius, who studied in Italy in the mid-1400s. This painting's linearity, realism, and emphasis on precise representation of detail typifies the style of artists in Ferrara, Italy, in the late 1400s. The Ferrarese court preferred profile views and delicate coloring, such as this unknown artist displayed. The delicacy and fine details suggest that the artist might have had experience in manuscript illumination. An unknown painter created this picture not long after oil painting was introduced into Italy from Northern Europe. The artist may have experimented with the new medium, possibly combining oil paint with Italy's traditional painting medium for both panels and manuscripts, tempera paint. The back of the panel is painted in imitation of porphyry, indicating that it may have been framed and hinged to a second panel, forming a diptych.
Shrouded in a heavy hooded cloak, an elderly man looks down with a deeply furrowed brow. As a personification of winter, the bust gives visual expression to the chilling cold of that season. His old age refers to winter's occurrence at the very end of the calendar year. Paul Heermann used delicate drillwork to create the border and ruffle on the cloak and the undercut locks of his long beard. The shadows made by his protruding forehead and the folds of his hood contrast dramatically with the luminous white of the marble, heightening the figure's psychological force and presence. This bust was probably part of a series of sculptures personifying the four seasons. At Versailles, Charles Le Brun established the fashion of including statues of the seasons in the program for garden sculpture. The high level of finish and finely worked details of this bust, however, suggest that Winter was meant to be viewed up close, in an indoor setting.
This oil sketch or modello was commissioned by Prince-Bishop Viet Adam for the main altarpiece of Freising Cathedral in southern Germany. In the center the Virgin Mary holds the Christ Child while trampling the serpent of sin, who curls around the moon at her feet. To the left the Archangel Michael and angels cast out Satan, the "great red dragon with seven heads," and other ghoulish demons. Above, God the Father instructs an angel to place a pair of wings on the Virgin's shoulders. Peter Paul Rubens contrasted good with evil by juxtaposing the agony and gruesomeness of the demons as they fall into hell with the Virgin and Child rising heavenward at the right. Rapid and gestural brushstrokes lend immediacy and drama to the scene.
In an arched, window-like opening, an astronomer works late into the night. Concentrating, he reads an astronomical treatise and measures the distance between two points on a celestial globe. The candle he holds provides the only source of light; it illuminates his face, the book, the precious globe, the beaker of water, and his hourglass. Strong contrasts between light and dark show the painter Gerrit Dou's knowledge of a popular Baroque technique known as chiaroscuro. Carefully rendering minute details such as the handwriting in the book, the texture of the glass flask, and the folds in the astronomer's cloak was Dou's special talent. Collectors treasured these small, detailed paintings for pleasurable observation in their private rooms.
Diana and her nymphs rest and bathe after the hunt, their catch guarded by a loyal hound, in an idealized landscape with classical ruins. As in his many other landscapes, Laurent de La Hyre rendered a romantic view of a river valley, a poetic setting for a nostalgic theme. Drawing from the work of Nicolas Poussin, La Hyre employed a classical composition with an orderly recession into space framed by trees. To Poussin's antiquarian interests, La Hyre added Claude Lorrain's limpid light effects.  Philippe de La Hyre, Laurent's eldest son, summed up his father's academic approach: "His subjects were placed in a landscape or architectural setting, which he treated with perfection according to all the rules of perspective, of which he had made a special study. Thus his works were in demand, and he himself was held in high esteem."  In the late 1600s, the Gobelins manufactory wove the design of this painting, along with Glaucus and Scylla and four other mythological designs by La Hyre, into a tapestry series on the loves of the gods.
Nymphs and satyrs participate in an ancient pagan feast celebrating Bacchus, the god of wine. Twisting, dancing, singing, and playing musical instruments, the small figures engage in unrestrained revelry, somewhat at odds with the dignified background of classical ruins.Alessandro Magnasco use a limited color palette for this painting, adding bright blue accents to represent swirling drapery. He created figures using quick, intuitive strokes of paint, producing a composition that appears full of movement. Magnasco painted this work, along with its pendant (also in the Getty�s collection), The Triumph of Venus, in Milan early in his career. His collaborator, Clemente Spera (c. 1661�1742), likely painted the architectural elements, which would explain the stark contrast between the linear, refined brushwork of the ruins and the more sketchy quality of Magnasco�s figures.
Somewhat disheveled, his eyes bleary from drink, King Ahasuerus leans heavily on his left forearm, spilling wine onto his lap from the goblet he holds. This painting shows a scene from the biblical Book of Esther, when, after seven days of feasting and drinking, King Ahasuerus drunkenly asks one of his eunuchs to summon the beautiful Queen Vashti. She refuses to appear, angering Ahasuerus and prompting him to dismiss her and choose Esther as his wife. Aert de Gelder places the characters against a neutral background and minimizes the action so that the focus is on the interaction between the two figures. Light falls from the left, highlighting the King's flushed face, extravagant clothing, and large frame. The dimly lit figure of the eunuch, modestly dressed, small in stature, and desexed, contrasts with the king's excessive appetites.
Once part of an altarpiece, this side wing and its companion were commissioned in 1408 by the confraternity of the Virgin and Saint Stephen for the church of Santo Stefano in Pane on the outskirts of Florence. The central panel featured a Coronation of the Virgin that is now in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.  Facing outward, an unkempt Saint John the Baptist wears a tunic made from an animal skin. Next to him, Saint John the Evangelist turns slightly to watch the coronation unfolding in the central panel. He holds a book, an allusion to his writings. Both saints are further identified by the inscriptions written beneath them. In a roundel above, an angel joins its hands in prayer.
Pre-industrial homemakers, artisans, and healers used mortars for grinding foodstuffs, dyes, and drugs. The rich friezes on this bronze mortar and its large size suggest that it had a ceremonial, rather than merely functional, purpose. Around the mortar's projecting rim runs a frieze of putto heads connected by garlands. Wrapping around the body of the mortar are the two deities, husband and wife, who ruled over the sea: on one side Neptune dominates a battle between sea centaurs while sea nymphs are being brought to Amphitrite on the other side. This maritime theme would have been particularly resonant in the port city of Venice. Lush acanthus leaves fill the space beneath a wide rim. The mortar's frieze demonstrates the Renaissance interest in classical culture. Not only are the narrative subjects drawn from Greek and Roman mythology, but the composition's balance and elegance and the decorative framing motifs betray the influence of classical Roman friezes. Foundries that produced utensils such as bells, basins, candlesticks, and cannons also cast mortars, even elaborately decorated ones. As was common for bell-metal, the alloy used for this mortar contains a high tin content.
"This little laundress is charming, but she's a rascal I wouldn't trust an inch," the critic Denis Diderot declared when this painting was first exhibited in 1761. Indeed, Jean-Baptiste Greuze stripped the traditional theme of the washerwoman of its association with the virtue of hard work and instead overlaid it with a titillating sensuality typical of Rococo art. In a room scattered with wet and drying laundry, a disheveled maidservant with an exposed stocking and slipper fixes the viewer with a provocative gaze. Greuze used a heavily loaded brush to apply patches of paint that describe texture and surface: the folds of the young woman's dress, the heaviness of wet cloth, the dull sheen on the pewter jug, and the grainy texture of wood.
Changing attitudes towards children and the emergence of a large middle class in eighteenth-century Europe increased the demand for portraits of children such as this one. Maria Frederike, the seven-year-old daughter of an aristocratic Dutch family, looks off to the side in a three-quarter view. Lost in thought, she is composed yet somewhat shy in comparison to her dog, who stares out with unabashed curiosity. With startling naturalism, Jean-�tienne Liotard captured her youth and beauty, setting off her eyebrows, lashes, and lustrous hair against her soft, fresh complexion. Liotard developed remarkable technical skills in the difficult medium of pastels. Brilliantly describing surfaces and defining volume through subtle gradations of color, he depicted forms, textures, and the play of light with great immediacy. He favored using pastels, especially for portraits of children, because they could be manipulated with greater speed and ease, had no odor, and allowed for frequent interruptions.
A woman getting ready for the ball is caught mid-sentence as the two women lean in to listen to her and the maid puts the finishing touches on her mistress�s hair. Partially disguised and holding masks, the ladies wear lavish cloaks in anticipation of the evening festivities ahead. Candles flicker, illuminating the eager faces of the group and contributing to the mood of hushed expectancy.
No Description
The decoration on this monumental cabinet refers to the French king Louis XIV's military victories. A panel of marquetry showing the cockerel of France standing triumphant over both the eagle of the Holy Roman Empire and the lion of Spain and the Spanish Netherlands decorates the central door. On the drawer above the door, gilt-bronze military trophies flank a medallion portrait of Louis XIV. In the Dutch Wars of 1672 to 1678, France fought simultaneously against the Dutch, Spanish, and Imperial armies, defeating them all. This cabinet celebrates the Treaty of Nijmegen, which concluded the war. Two large figures from Greek mythology, Hercules and Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, representatives of strength and bravery in war, appear to support the cabinet.  The fleurs-de-lis on the top two drawers indicate that the cabinet was made for Louis XIV. As it does not appear in inventories of his possessions, it may have served as a royal gift. The Sun King's portrait appears twice on this work. The bronze medallion above the central door was cast from a medal struck in 1661 that shows the king at the age of twenty-one. Another medallion inside shows him a few years later.  The pair to this cabinet still exists in Scotland. Both cabinets probably entered England in the early nineteenth century after the French Revolution caused the dispersal of so many French collections.
Mercury was messenger to Jupiter and served as patron of travel, commerce, science, and thievery in Greek and Roman mythology. Johan Gregor van der Schardt shows the young, athletic figure of Mercury, identified by the winged sandals and hat he wears and the caduceus he carries, as he effortlessly returns from flight. Van der Schardt suggested the spontaneity of his landing through the asymmetry of his body: Mercury tilts his head and twists his body so that his right hip comes forward while his right shoulder swings back. Mercury was cast hollow from a wax model. After casting, the hair and parts of the wings and sandals were reworked with chisels to accentuate their crispness. In the late sixteenth century, the Getty Museum's Mercurybelonged to Paul Praun, a Nuremberg collector who lived in Bologna and assembled a legendary art collection there.
On a rocky, stagelike, surface, Adonis lies mortally wounded after being attacked by a boar while his lover, the goddess Venus, rushes in to tend him. Her fluttering drapery indicating that she has just landed, Venus leans over the youth, already seeing death in his eyes. In the foreground, a tearful putto examines Adonis's wound; behind, a putto pulls Adonis's dog away from the dead boar. Massimiliano Soldani-Benzi closely followed Ovid's Metamorphoses, a classical text that was much read in Baroque Italy. The choice of bronze also suggests an interest in classical culture. This rendition, however, is full of Baroque drama and movement. In particular, the bronze's flamboyant, tragic tone and shallow, frontal composition recall theatrical and operatic productions of the time. Soldani-Benzi was known as one of the finest bronze casters in Florence, frequently casting works of other sculptors. Venus and Adonisis one of his few original mythological groups. This tabletop sculpture originally formed a pair with another, now-lost bronze couple, Tancred and Clorinda, historical figures immortalized in Tasso's epic poem, Gerusalemme Liberata.
Renaissance artists revived the mosaic technique from the early Christian period, considering it particularly appropriate for commemorative portraits since mosaic tiles, composed of ceramic or glass, preserved their color more permanently than paintings. Giovanni Battista Calandra here depicts Camillo Rospigliosi, brother of Pope Clement IX and Knight Commander of the Order of Santo Stefano, whose cross insignia adorns his chest. Despite the medium's technical challenges, Calandra reproduces some of the naturalistic techniques of contemporary painting. He may even have copied a painting, as was common practice among mosaicists. Calandra positions the sitter at a slight angle, employing perspective to represent the foreshortened chest and shoulders. In addition, he carefully renders the gradations of hair color resulting from changes in light and sfumato, the effect of light giving way to darkness behind the sitter. The embroidered cross showing through Rospigliosi's collar is a notable tour de force in subtle coloring. The portrait may have been part of a funerary monument or, alternately, Rospigliosi may have displayed it in his home.

The woman with the straw hat and the bearded man, colored with great refinement, are characteristic types in Craesbeeck's repertory of figures. Possibly influenced by Caravaggio's followers, Craesbeeck paid careful attention to the effects of light, which streams into the room from a single window.
After curing Tobit's blindness, returning the family's wealth, and making it possible for Tobit's son Tobias to marry his beloved Sarah, the Archangel Raphael has dropped his disguise and revealed himself as an angel, saying, "I was not acting on my own will, but by the will of God." Such a scene of miraculous intervention was especially attractive to Protestants in Holland, who believed in doctrines of faith, mercy, and divine grace.Jan Victors took his subject from the Book of Tobit, among the Apocrypha in the Old Testament. Borrowing elements from his teacher Rembrandt van Rijn's 1637 rendition of the subject, Victors set his figures before and within an architectural setting and opened the composition to a clouded landscape on one side. Strong contrasts of light and dark and a foreshortened angel, flying away on a diagonal and viewed from the back, give the scene animation and urgency. Victors's characteristically careful interpretation of surface details includes beautifully rendered highlights on the costumes and Tobias's head.
Although he was reportedly a prolific painter, this panel is one of only seven paintings by Martin Schongauer in existence today. It belongs to a group of four Andachtsbilder, or devotional paintings, created near the end of his life. In his engravings Schongauer already had explored the theme of the Madonna and Child reading a book in a niche, symbolizing the Virgin's role as Christ's tutor. Here he balanced the Madonna's serenity with the lively ChristChild and the book's fluttering pages. Her dignified face, with its polished modeling and delicate features, is typical of Schongauer, who was heavily influenced by Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden's art. Mary's cascade of gently flowing hair shows Schongauer's sensitivity to the expressive potential of line. His attention to detail is especially evident in the thin gold seams in Mary's cloak, the jeweled crown, and the figures' fine facial features. In the background, an angel holds the crown and scepter. Since the 1500s, Schongauer has been credited with bringing the advances of Netherlandish Renaissance art to Germany. He was the main inspiration for Germany's next generation of artists, notably Albrecht D�rer. Schongauer's engravings had far-reaching impact, influencing Italian artists such as Michelangelo.
The original function of this painting is unknown, but its scale and subject matter imply that it was perhaps independently commissioned by an individual, intended for personal devotion or display in a small private chapel. The unconventional iconography of this painting typifies Parmigianino�s innovative work. The Virgin and Child are separated from one another; while she reaches across to clutch him by the wrist, he turns away to converse with and embrace his cousin, Saint John the Baptist, whose hands are joined in prayer. Between them is a young woman with beautifully coiffed but partially unbound flowing locks, who is supporting the Christ Child under her arms; she is most likely Mary Magdalene, although in older literature on the painting she was often misinterpreted as Saint Catherine of Alexandria. Her true identity is established by the foreground still life, which includes a string of pearls and a stiletto of the sort used in the preparation of one�s toilette, and also by a representation of her ecstatic bodily assumption in the upper left of the composition. In what may well be his final work of this kind, Parmigianino employed his usual method of dividing the composition between a group on one side and a single figure on the other.The painting�s support is composed of several sheets of paper, carefully laid down and smoothed onto a wood panel. Extremely well-preserved, the Virgin and Child with Saint John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene exhibits Parmigianino�s characteristic polished and enamel-like paint surface and meticulous attention to detail, and presents a supreme example of the artist�s mature style.
"This little laundress is charming, but she's a rascal I wouldn't trust an inch," the critic Denis Diderot declared when this painting was first exhibited in 1761. Indeed, Jean-Baptiste Greuze stripped the traditional theme of the washerwoman of its association with the virtue of hard work and instead overlaid it with a titillating sensuality typical of Rococo art. In a room scattered with wet and drying laundry, a disheveled maidservant with an exposed stocking and slipper fixes the viewer with a provocative gaze.Greuze used a heavily loaded brush to apply patches of paint that describe texture and surface: the folds of the young woman's dress, the heaviness of wet cloth, the dull sheen on the pewter jug, and the grainy texture of wood.
In this gentle allegory of peace by Louis Jean Fran�ois Lagren�e, Mars, the Roman god of War, throws back the rich green bed curtains that frame the scene. As the drapery parts, the morning light spills in to reveal the form of the sleeping Venus, the Roman goddess of love. Mars gazes at her, utterly captivated by her beauty. Her love has tempered his fierce character, and his shield and sword lie abandoned on the floor. Echoing the lovers' bliss, a pair of white doves, symbolizing Peace, build a nest in Mars's helmet.Lagren�e created his finest works, including this small, jewel-like painting, around 1770. The lavish folds of drapery, the delicate play of light over fabric and skin, and the rich, restrained palette combine to create a captivatingly beautiful image.
This figure probably once formed part of a series of figures of various street vendors. He holds out an apron displaying a fish, grapes, a slice of melon, and two cucumbers. After buying fish, fruits, or vegetables at market, these vendors walked through the streets of the towns, advertising their wares with shouts or songs. The modeler at the Mennecy porcelain manufactory may have copied this figure from one of many engraved series of "Cries of Paris" depicting such hawkers. There were so many hawkers, forming a potentially powerful group, that the king allowed them special privileges, including free entry to certain theatrical performances.This idealized view of a peasant with his sturdy clogs, short jacket, and apron appealed to wealthy patrons, who ordered large numbers of these figures. Designers created such small sculptures to be seen from all sides as table decorations.

In Torquato Tasso's 1581 epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (Jerusalem Delivered), the legendary medieval knight Rinaldo is bewitched by the beautiful sorceress Armida and lulled into a life of easy sensuality on the Fortunate Isles. His friends, the knights Carlo and Ubaldo, enter her garden and break her spell by showing Rinaldo a magic mirror-shield. His military spirit reawakened, Rinaldo later rejoins his companions in the enchanted forest.
The medieval Christian knight Rinaldo has entered the enchanted forest, where monstrous apparitions have prevented his men from gathering wood to build their war-machines. Earlier, his companions had rescued him from the sorceress Armida's garden, and now they in turn require his assistance. Suddenly, hundreds of tree nymphs appear, surrounding Rinaldo, and the sorceress Armida appears from within a large myrtle tree, begging the knight to renew their love. His sword unsheathed, Rinaldo advances to strike the tree, thus overcoming the enchantment and enabling the Crusaders' liberation of Jerusalem to proceed.

Without arms or complete legs, this nude evokes a rediscovered antique sculpture. But the perfectly smooth bronze surface reveals that this is in fact a more modern creation. Her head tilted downward, the figure holds a pensive gaze. The closely observed hairstyle and relatively detailed facial features indicate the artist's desire to capture a particular individual. The viewer is also encouraged to consider the body's elegant lines and robust volumes. Dina Vierny was Aristide Maillol's longtime model, confidant, and collaborator. She began sitting for the sculptor around 1934 and did so until the artist's death in 1944. Most of his sculpture and drawings executed during this period take Vierny as their subject. This sculpture is believed to be one of very few works Maillol executed from life. He rarely sculpted from a live model, instead carving his plasters from sketches based on long sessions with his subject.
The panel depicting the grieving Saint John along with another showing the Virgin Mary, also owned by the museum, were originally part of a larger Crucifixion scene representing figures mourning the death of Christ at the foot of the cross. The delicate modeling of the face and hand was achieved by applying vitreous paint to colorless glass and then stabbing it with a broad brush to create points of light. The paint was then contoured with a pointed brush, creating expressive, almost calligraphic linework, as seen in Saint John's tousled hair and distraught look.
Through strict profile in the manner of ancient Roman coins, William Hoare captures the commanding personality and charisma of Henry Hoare II (1705 - 1785). Although not related, the artist was a personal friend and frequent guest of the sitter, which enabled him to perceptively portray Henry Hoare's character. Astute management of the family bank, C. Hoare & Co., financed Henry's extensive patronage of the arts, earning him the nickname "The Magnificent.'' Under his direction, the garden at Stourhead, his family home, was transformed into one of the earliest and finest examples of the English landscape garden.

Saint John the Evangelist is shown writing in a book while standing beside an eagle, his attribute. The figure stands on a small plinth and is flanked by moldings or pilasters indicating an architectural setting. The composition is suggestive of sculpture on a heavily articulated fa�ade or carved surface. The museum owns two other fragments from what must have been a larger ensemble (Virgin and Child with Saint John and A Prophet or Elder).
